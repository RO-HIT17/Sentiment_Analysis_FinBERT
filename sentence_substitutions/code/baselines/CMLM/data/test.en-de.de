However , the speaker rebuts this by mentioning that the noises from the giant squid could always be heard while the strange sounds just last about two decades .
The third theory in the reading claims that perhaps the sounds came from foreign submarines that Russian submarines were not able to detect .
In conclusion , the professor pointed out the inconsistencies between the reading and the listening passages and explained why the arguments in the speech are more reliable .
It may be true that knowing unrelated events does n't provide convenience to our lives directly . Such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that people do n't need to get in touch with those messages .
As far as social relationships , globalization and efficiency are concerned , my opinion is that people do have the need to know about all kinds of events .
To begin with , everybody knowing current events benefits social relationships , for knowing the same thing creates topics for people to talk about .
In the meantime , we can get a deeper understanding of people by seeing people 's attitudes towards different things , which means strengthening their connections with people .
Furthermore , considering the increasing pace of globalization , it 's necessary to keep getting the message of things that are happening all over the world .
Originally there was no world , and heaven and earth are still connected together , Pangu picked up a big axe to split the world and the earth , and then there was the world .
At first , the world was chaos , there was no sign of life , so the son-in-law used mud to pinch out the shape of human beings , any human beings , for the world to bring life .
Today 's maps are also becoming more and more detailed , and you can see every corner of the world from home through the map .
With the development of science and technology , mankind knows that the earth is a sphere , and also knows many once unknown secrets .
This paper presents a review of different techniques such as conventional , optimization , artificial intelligence computational , hybrid , others , and current optimization techniques for impact assessment of DGs with EVs in distribution systems . ZIP is the coefficients of a load model comprised of constant impedance Z , constant current I , and constant power P load models from minimization of real and reactive power losses of the system for enhancement of system performances .
These years of work experience have also made me deeply aware of the importance of academic certificates , so I used online learning and self-study exams to complete the college diploma and undergraduate degree after work .
In order to improve my abilities and take care of my personal hobbies , since 2013 , I have signed consulting contracts with three British companies to provide online and on-site services to telecom operators in South Africa , Angola , Thailand , Malaysia , and Malawi .
Because of the time zone difference , I need to maintain close communication with the R & D and service teams in China to ensure the stability of telecommunications network equipment .
These jobs can bring me at least $ 4 , 800 a month in income , but staying up late will endanger my health , so I will choose to work for a period of time and then take a few months of rest .
I can relax by traveling and doing exercise in the gym to help myself recover , but more importantly , I will have more time to spend with my family .
Although I have had several opportunities for further interviews , the interviewer recognized my work experience and business abilities , but what made me frustrated was that I did not have a full-time college diploma , so I could not win the interview .
In the process of many interviews , I also noticed that many candidates also have overseas study experience , and their English communication skills have also been recognized by employers .
With the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus , my hometown , Wuhan , has been locked for 76 days since January 23 , 2020 .
I hope to find a balance between work and family , so I am determined to finish a full-time program to fill the blanks in my education to enhance my competitiveness in the workplace .
This choice takes into account the time cost , living improvement of English skills , and the future development trend of the IT industry .
Some people say that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support , while others oppose the idea .
Second , students ' social abilities are as crucial as learning . With equal financial support in classes , the school can provide more social activities to maintain students ' social ability .
In modern society , most people wo n't meet other people often , so it is important to teach students how to socialize with others .
Lastly , students can learn to cooperate with others through sports and social activities , which is vital for their future , and can not learn from classes and libraries .
Take basketball as an example . When playing basketball , people need to pass the ball to others to try to get the scores , however , if people do n't cooperate with others and just want to get the scores themselves , it will make the team lose the game .
So learning cooperation from sports can enhance students ' cooperation which they ca n't just learn by reading textbooks in the classroom .
In conclusion , supporting sports and social activities with equal finance can benefit students by protecting them from being hurt and enhancing their social ability , also they can learn how to cooperate with others which they do n't have a chance to learn .
To write an excellent medical paper , first and foremost , the right usage of words and sentences in proper tense and sequence as well as appropriate citing in every part of the manuscript is of great importance , including the title , abstract , introduction , method , result , and discussion .
Briefly , a concise , accurate , abstract , indexed , and specific conclusion sentence conveys the main topics of the study with an important word first is more attractive .
In addition to using full-name words and simple , concise , objective , complete and consistent sentences , an abstract should select the highlights from each section of the paper to provide an overview of the research , generally including the purpose , method , result , and conclusion of the paper .
As for the introduction , you should include 4 aspects , namely the introduction of the state of knowledge in this area , important issues that remain unanswered , the purpose of your research , and the means to overcome these problems .
The species , numbers , time , setting , variables , processing and analyzing approaches , the source of all materials , and informed consent processes should all be included .
Then come to the result part . You should report all the results pertinent to the question posed in the introduction including both experimental and control results , and minimize interpretation .
Secondly , it will be better to cast your results in the context of other studies and outlook on how your work extends what is known .
It is also hard for individuals to get overall information about one job because the information online is scarcely comprehensive .
He asked his friends if he should change his job from biology to computer science , as his friend told him that programming was a horrible job that made people exhausted and unhealthy .
As time goes on , I come to realize that certain characters , which are imperturbation , circumspection , and boldness , need to change . Because these qualities are the hallmarks of a great man and are awfully significant .
It means that when a man deals with troubles , he should think and analyze them from multiple perspectives , and he can not act in an impulsive manner .
For example , when he is in trouble , he must always keep his head clear and use a magnifying glass to look for opportunities that may exist in the problem .
Just imagine the annoyance caused by a thing being repeated over and over again , so carefulness is really important in life .
In this impetuous society , it 's hard to have these qualities , but it is for that reason that all men need to strive to improve .
His wealth was not good , and he wanted time to investigate some of the curious phenomena he had encountered over the years .
Although he retired from the business of innovation , he continued to work on the phonograph and engaged in one last inventive campaign .
He even disregard his near-total deafness-assumed responsibility for the selection of all the music and artists recorded for the Edison phonograph , a truly disastrous policy .
The Secretary of the Navy appointed him head of the Naval Consulting Board in 1915 to review inventions submitted for the nation 's defense , and Edison conducted his own defense research after America 's entry into the war .
In addition to his inventions and contributions in phonography , electric light , telephone , telegraph , film , and other fields , he also had many creations and insights in mining , construction , the chemical industry , and other fields .
It is hard to deny that relationships among people usually enhance when they play sports together , and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that playing sports within a group is an ideal choice for themselves .
As far as convenience , efficiency , and relationships are concerned , I strongly believe that doing exercise alone is a better option than playing sports within a group .
It is more convenient for people to exercise alone , since different people usually have various schedules , and it is hard to figure out an available time and location for the group .
In fact , most people tend to play sports with people who they are familiar with , but those people can not always be present at that time and the space where people want to play sports because of work and life stuff .
Compared with this , doing exercise alone releases such conflict , so people can do their sports at any time and in any location without the concern of whether others are available .
Because it is common for people to talk when they do sports together , they must spend more time on exercise than those who exercise alone .
Had it not been for playing sports together , Jimmie would not have been late for that meeting by effectively completing her running .
To conclude , after a thorough analysis of the aforementioned statements , I shall maintain that doing exercise alone is a better option than playing sports within a group .
It is my firm belief that it would benefit students no matter what their major is for a number of reasons , and I will develop these ideas in the subsequent paragraphs .
Before graduating from university and trying to become successful men , we should first become good citizens which also means informed citizens , and no one can consider himself or herself to be an informed citizen without a knowledge of history .
For example , I learned American history when I was in high school , which encouraged me to develop a greater appreciation for the legacies of America 's great leaders .
It 's packed with tales of how someone stood up for what they believed in , died for love , or worked hard to make their dreams come true .
All of those things are concepts we can relate to and it is enriching to know that so could the likes of Abraham Lincoln , Thomas Jefferson , or Martin Luther King .
As a result , it helps us become more compassionate as people and more impartial as decision makers which is crucial for everybody no matter whether you want to become an engineer or an artist .
Taking a variety of classes , not just those within your specific major , can help you find other topics that you are interested in .
This can prompt you to take up new hobbies , learn new things , or even change the direction of your studies altogether .
Moreover , it may also allow for some new opportunities such as interdisciplinary studies , internships , and study abroad , adding depth to the overall college experience .
So , definitely , I have to say that learning history , though it is not about your major , has the potential to guide you in finding your true passions and could even change what you decide to do in life .
Having a broad education and varied knowledge can help you perform in any job you end up working in after you graduate .
Though it should not be the main reason to learn history , it is a fact that interviewers do favor applicants who are well-rounded .
Taking those classes not related to your major will not only pad your resume but also tell the admissions counselor or employer that you are disciplined , curious , and hardworking .
In light of the above-mentioned reasons , I strongly believe that all university students should be required to take history classes because it just benefits a lot , especially for a student in university , to explore his or her interests and be a well-rounded person .
As is explicitly depicted in the enlightening picture , standing on the left are many graduates who face four directions including seeking of job , going out abroad , and so on .
The picture does provide an insight into the importance of the future of choice and the phenomenon that many graduates , if not most , tend to face more difficult choices .
On the social level , such a phenomenon which makes great contributions to the stability and harmony of our society can be attributed to more and more graduates ' choice to suit themselves road and dedicate themselves to society .
On the individual level , according to Maslow 's hierarchy of needs , after people 's basic needs , like physiological needs and safety needs , have been met , they begin to look for something more spiritual , such as finding a relaxed job of making a living , and try their best to be happy for future .
For example , without the goal of choosing a future on the road , you could face a sea of trouble behind the lives of graduation .
Meanwhile , when it comes to the question of whether the rules that societies today expect young people to follow and obey are too strict , different people may have different answers .
As far as I am concerned , I think the rules that today young people need to follow are n't strictly based on the following reasons .
First and foremost , with the development of modern civilization and the effect of globalization , lots of new concepts that criticize bad old rules are coming into our society .
These concepts have a great influence on people 's minds and let them abandon many old strict rules , including table manners , street manners , and so on .
For example , in traditional China , young people needed to turn down their knees to show their respect to old people like their parents or their teachers .
This rule may cause young people to be afraid of their parents and unwilling to talk to their parents from the bottom of their hearts , which would make young people want to resist their parents in the future .
Today , we hardly see any strict rules that would become setbacks between our parents and their children in Chinese families .
Furthermore , Teachers would have a better understanding of where their students may not be clear about the new knowledge and thus design some special training or additional study to strengthen students ' study .
As a matter of fact , young people did n't need to obey too many strict rules and could have a relatively relaxing life .
There are two fibers for the phone line , so in total , we would have 3 fibers ( 1 core ) from ChinaUnicom .
In case you can reach Cassie , could you please check with her which way would be fine for them , signing one more set or making the amendment on one of the current ones ?
Before I entered Temple University , I heard that in the United States , no one under the age of 21 is allowed to buy alcohol , and students under 21 are not allowed to drink in their dorms .
Foreign countries are more open , and the phenomenon of university male or female students living together is not rare , so schools will also provide some sex supplies in order to prevent HIV or other sexual diseases .
People often possess different opinions towards the issue that the young can not influence important decisions that determine the future of society today .
To be more specific , most young men tend to be couch potatoes during weekends , leading to not concerning about social issues .
To conclude , I totally agree with the claim that young people today have no influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as a whole .
With the proliferation of schools and private firms nowadays , it is sometimes argued that a company or campus should have strict rules that control the type of clothing that people wear at work and at school .
To elaborate , people in the same group will recognize their colleagues or participants easier and the manager could arrange the whole team in the most efficient way .
For instance , it can prevent pupils from falling in love with others for their attractive look efficiently and this is one reason why most schools all over the world would like to have rules about wearing uniforms .
However , in my opinion , focusing on good looking will affect working and studying badly , because it is simply a waste of time .
Communication , an important method for people to exchange information and develop ideas , has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over whether it is more valuable for groups to communicate about a project in person rather than through e-mail .
In contrast to these opinions , it is my perspective that it is discussed by e-mail , rather than in person , that can help improve utilization , due to the benefits it brings to the groups between classmates and colleagues .
What must be prioritized is that it is efficient for classmates to communicate by sending e-mails , rather than having meetings , which can save time and reduce errors .
For explanation , e-mails are so convenient that they can present essential information in short messages , thus time should be spent on communication can be distributed to finishing tasks , which improves the whole efficiency of projects ; on the other hand , private meetings are more time-consuming since it is always low-effective that presenting ideas by talking than through texts , which may waste much time .
In industrialized countries , as many as 25 % to 40 % percent of work-related deaths occurred on construction sites , even though the construction industry employed only 6 % to 10 % percent of the workforce ( ILO , 2005 ) .
In the past two decades , the construction industry has remained one of the leading dangerous industries in Germany ( Melzner et al. , 2013 ) .
A reportable accident in Germany is a situation that either leads to an inability to work for more than three workdays or death during work or when commuting .
Though there has been a witnessed decreased trend in accident rate , 103 , 731 reportable work accidents were still witnessed in the year 2014 .
When relating the accident injuries in the construction industry to the number of full-time employees , construction industry in Germany has 55 , 87 reportable accidents based on 1000 full-time workers in the year 2014 , which is 2 , 5 times of the average number ( 22 , 27 ) of all industries ( Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung , 2014 ) .
A great number of efforts have been made to improve construction safety , leading to the reportable accidents ( every 1 . 000 workers ) decreasing from 10 , 971 to 5 , 587 , almost half of the accident number of 20 years ago . However , it could not be ignored that the accident rate is still high .
Table 1 . 1 shows the reportable work accidents in the construction industry in Germany from the year 1995 to 2014 , coming from the Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung annual report .
Second , I would equip myself with fundamental and advanced techniques such as statistics , information science , and environment-protecting knowledge , which ensure that I master the academic ability to come up with effective environmental policy .
I would pay attention to learning Japanese well to ensure that I can understand the core culture of Japan and use it to learn further academic content in Japanese .
What 's more , I am open to learning another language to help me feel the world better and extend my circle of friends .
Considering the principle of legality where the courts would not construe the statute to infringe or abrogate fundamental freedom unless the Parliament expresses unmistakably its intention to do so ( Coco ) , the narrow construction would not be codified by this principle .
This is because the Parliament has the intention to limit personal liberty identified as fundamental rights by the unequivocal language without allowing the diagnosed person to leave the residence or places except for certain circumstances ( Momcilovic ; Aboriginal Justice ; s4 ) .
Overall , Carrie 's conduct might not constitute the exception under section 4 ( 3 ) based on the statutory interpretation of considering the text , context , and purpose , and she does not have an exemption under section 6 . Thereby , she is probably guilty of an offense under section 10 .
It was revised as `` However , some previous studies on pneumatic catapults are based on the hypothesis of the ideal gas and adiabatic , and others based on the real gas effects but not consider the convective heat transfer . But few studies take the real gas effects and the convective heat transfer into consideration at the same time `` .

As we can see , the first Product launch time in May 2016 . Then in 2019 , they made a new product which was introduced this year .
We 've perfected the ideal combination of droplet size , spray pattern , and droplet velocity that results in the best thermal performance yet .
When compared to Nebia 2 . 0 , the droplets are 61 % but larger in mass ( 17 % but larger in diameter ) , which significantly increases their ability to retain heat .
However , in the lecture , the professor puts forward three opposite points to illustrate that such a colonization plan is not practical .
First , even though the reading says that the low gravity of asteroids has lots of merits considering it is easier and safer for spacecraft to land , and it also allows spacecraft to bring more cargo and equipment , the professor argues in the lecture that such low-gravity environment will exert a bad influence on people 's health condition since muscle and bone density would considerably lose .
Second , the reading suggests that the mining industry on asteroids would be highly profitable due to the numerous valuable elements and precious metals buried under the asteroids .
By contrast , the professor refutes this idea and insists that it will not be that profitable when the cost is taken into consideration .
Third , the reading claims that it is easy for humans to reach the asteroids since some asteroids would periodically come within or near Earth 's orbit .
On the contrary , the professor points out that it is not easy for humans to return to Earth from asteroids .
Some people like to watch news presented by people who have different perspectives from them , while some people like to check the news made by people who have similar views to them .
First , I think it 's important to expose ourselves to different viewpoints of both sides of a coin , as it is helpful to cultivate our critical thinking skills .
Sometimes , people tend to think from a certain perspective to be self-evident . They never try to look at the same thing from a different angle .
Thus , they might hold some ideas without awareness or doubt that these ideas may turn out to be totally wrong .
If we are more open-minded and willing to accept new ideas , we are more likely to find new solutions to the same problem and know the world around us better .
For example , some parents think a gap year is purely a waste of time and money for their children , so they will never support their kids to have a gap year before they go to college .
No one likes to deal with people who ca n't adopt other people 's advice and insist that only his or her idea is correct .
Because of his bias and unfairness , no one will point out the mistakes he made during a meeting for a marketing campaign or offer better solutions to a problem .
Eventually , he would get fired because of a serious mistake he made even though some of the group members already knew this mistake could be avoided .
To sum up , it 's essential for people to get in touch with information or news which is made by people who might stand on the opposite side of you as you can learn to think critically and help you to be more successful in your career .
Education , the foundation of quality of life , has been elaborated on and even triggers heated discussions over whether it is easier to be educated today than past .
To explain it further , when young people have some questions , they can ask the teacher to acquire more knowledge by using the cellphone , which is the most convenient way to know the answer . But how can old people gain such knowledge in the past , when the smartphone did not occurred ?
People tend to get different answers when looking at it from a different angle , so there is no right or wrong .
For example , in the past , people had to wait for months to get a letter from their lover , had to walk two hours to school , and had to calculate every formula by their bare hands and brains .
We are capable of making crops which can resist many kinds of unideal factors , such as colds , bugs , or even drought .
In the past , farmers had to spend a lot of time and mind for their crops , or their crops might die due to the environment .
However , with innovative genetic technology , farmers can live a simpler life compared to the past , and have better yield since those plants are not afraid of the bad environment any more .
Every country has its unique history , and our world can be so diverse and distinctive because of these different historical backgrounds .
From this point of view , some people suggest that universities should require their students to take history courses regardless of their field of study .
First of all , learning the history of their own countries can help university students realize the strengths and weaknesses of their countries , which assists them to decide ways of contributing to the development of their countries .
They may just work diligently after graduation , but can not come up with methods with which they can see their contribution more obviously .
However , if a student has the chance to know more deeply about history , such as economic development , agriculture and art creation in diverse dynasties , they may have a clearer direction of working .
For example , students in the economics major can find a way of making money suiting the country from a long period ago , and students majoring in the arts can discover the pattern of the art development of the country and think about creating new products .
If the universities teach these undergraduates about the history of their own countries , they can do efficient cultural diffusion in the future .
He went abroad to study math five years ago , and when he was on a foreign campus , he told his friends a lot about the life and interesting culture in China .
When he came back to China , many of his friends were willing to go back with him , which means he harvested a group of geniuses for his country .
As video games have developed readily for several years , those entertainments influence the younger generation widely . Therefore , do some courses include these materials to become efficient ways for young students ?
Some people contend that those methods can improve students ' motivation to absorb information , while others advocate that this technology will definitely distract their attention .
First of all , playing video games will diminish children 's concentration in class , given that they will waste their time participating in those amusements .
For example , students who are five to eight years old lack maturity . They do not realize the limitation of applying electronic products , so the younger generation will dedicate their full time to those negative electronic resources , such as fierce films , irregular websites , and so on .
What is more , if young students keep making use of video games in some lessons , their caliber of watching objects will decrease , granted that they avail themselves of exhibiting sight too much .
According to recent statistics , there is ample coverage demonstrating that there are more children suffering from near-sightedness when they are only five to eight years old , on account of bright light from those electronic merchandise and the large amount of time on video games , those factors cause the younger generation are unfavorable to enjoy precise eyesight and undergo an abundance of surgeries .
Admittedly , viewing from the opposite perspective , certain people may claim that it is more persuasive to imply that video games are advantageous for the younger generation , due to the fact that those actions could facilitate them to learn effectively .
Those who bolster the idea might indicate this operation either is interesting to allow them to engage in a relaxed atmosphere or spend less time focusing on solid books .
However , it seems to me that those opponents do not comprehend this specific scheme . Although this project will intensify a few forces for young students to study , it can sustain just for a short period of time , and children will end up playing video games in their lectures rather than concentrating on what teachers teach .
To sum up , I still believe that it is harmful that young students take advantage of video games to acquire content during the learning process .
Finally , in order to overcome covid-19 , every country needs to work together , which , in some way , means that globalization can be strengthened .
Globalists view the coronavirus as a global threat that shows the common plight of humanity and the need to work together .
Instead of hoarding medical masks through export controls , countries should work together to ensure that all states have sufficient medical supplies .
Countries should encourage scientists from around the world to work together to find a vaccine , rather than resorting to `` sicken-thy-neighbor '' export bans on medical supplies .
So far , the United Nations has not been a leader in the global response to the new coronavirus , and it has ceded at least some of that role to individual countries .
According to the passage , the author points out three theories regarding the purposes of the jars from the Plain of Jars , an archeological site in the Asian country of Laos .
Firstly , even though the passage claims that the jars were used for fermentation , the speaker suggests that compared to stone jars , clay jars are easier to make and are more commonly used by local people for fermenting beverages .
Secondly , the professor casts doubt on the idea in the reading that the jars were used for water storage for traders who traveled through the trade route .
He further explains that the trade route was near to rivers and streams , thus the travelers did not need jars to contain fresh water .
Finally , contrary to the passage that since there are many artifacts found around the jars , the Plain of Jar may be an ancient burial site and the jars were bombs for holding human remains , the professor states that the theory has a serious problem .
And the wild panda increased from 1200 to 1864 in 30 years . The scientists know how long it takes for the individual panda to adjust to the wild .
The scientist also found that captive breeding reduced gut microbial diversity of pandas . Researchers made a plan to balance the metabolic potential of captive pandas . And scientists suggest keeping an increasing amount of panda in the wild .
It is true that traveling to popular sites has some benefits , such as having more fun , playing with more friends , and sharing more experiences .
How a government spends its money is certainly a topic people care about since most of the government funds come from taxes .
While others argue that governments should spend more money on supporting the arts , it is my firm belief that governments should spend more money in support of athletics for several reasons , including promoting exercising and creating more governmental incomes .
For example , the government in my city sponsored a high school hockey team to attend an international tournament two years ago .
This is because it lets athletes train with better equipment and coaches , which in turn makes them perform better on the field .
For instance , our country 's government made a huge investment in updating the national sports teams ' facilities , which allowed our national team to achieve better in the last Olympic games .
Based on the reasons mentioned above , it is legitimate to say that governments should spend money in support of athletics due to the advantages .
One essential opinion that affects my standpoint is that assigning homework every day is an efficient method to improve students ' academic performance .
Another contributing factor is that doing some practice of study every day is helpful for children to build healthy learning habits .
There is no doubt that letting students decide how many and how often they could do study assignments is more flexible .
For example , some people maybe prefer to do one thing for one whole day rather than distribute time for two or three things .
However , most students do n't have sufficient self-control , which would lead to worse situations , like playing video games or watching TV all day , or playing outside for several days .
Weighing up what has been mentioned above , setting assignments for students and helping them learn to alternate study with rest is more essential .
Assigning homework that students must do every day produces a positive impact to help students to build up favorable learning habits and improve their academic performance .
On New Year 's Day in the 8th grade , it was the first time I watched the `` Vienna New Year Concert '' performed by the Austrian Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra alone .
In China , every New Year 's Day TV will broadcast this concert based on music composed by the famous music family - the Strauss family .
The music adopts a realistic technique , and through symphony forms , a detailed description of the starting , accelerating , moving , and pitting of the steam train is carried out .
People hear this music as if they are sitting on a steam train , watching the lush Austrian forests and mountains as the train moves .
Therefore , in order to appreciate these symphonies well , people need to understand the background of the time the composer lives in , the composer 's life experience , and the composer 's musical style .
These aspects often cover a lot of professional knowledge in the history of Western music , and this knowledge is beyond ordinary people 's understanding .
Therefore , when many people appreciate symphony works , they will feel barriers and obstacles , and thus can not accept symphony as a musical form .
For example , the string part simulates the feeling of the train accelerating little by little through a large number of jumping fast rhythms , and the player in the middle part of the music through blowing .
When enjoying this piece , people can directly follow the progress of the piece to feel the picture constructed between the various instruments without exploring its creative background .
By appreciating this piece , I understand that not all symphony works are `` Yangchun Baixue '' that people do not understand , and some symphony works are related to people 's lives .
Since I listened to this song `` Steam Train Polka '' , I understand that the reason why a good job can be passed down to the world is precise that it can be accepted and loved by the world .
And since then , every time I write an article , I will analyze the information I found first , and then write after I build the structure , which also improves my collaboration efficiency .
Since December , the world has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) .
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness , including viral shedding , have not been well described .
First , despite the statement the reading material asserted that airships use less fuel because they do not need to provide vertical lift , the professor claims that airships need two kinds of lighter-than-air gas .
The one is easy to catch fire , and the other one is hard to obtain although it is easier to get .
While according to the audio , using airships to carry logs in the forests needs to be steady which can not be offered by airships .
Finally , the passage points out that airships can replace satellites with all kinds of equipment since airships can stay high above surface for a long time , which is contradicted by the speaker .
Due to the development of modern technology and other varied factors , the lives of young people are getting more and more complicated .
Even though the issue is becoming increasingly critical , many believe it is not essential for the young to learn how to plan and organize .
However , I would argue against them by claiming that mastering the ability to plan and organize is quite important for young people because it will not only help them to do things more efficiently , but will also help them in their future development .
On the one hand , as the world today is becoming more and more complex , it is necessary for the young to learn how to plan and organize , for such action will help the young to be more efficient .
Therefore , they may not waste a lot of time doing useless things , enabling them to finish quite more things in limited time .
On the contrary , if not planned well , things would altogether be a mess and the young people would waste a lot of time on useless things like window-shopping .
When I was in middle school , every morning , I was used to listing all the things I would do on that day .
As a result , to make sure that I fulfil the goal I made every day , I would prevent myself from doing unnecessary things like playing for a long time in the playground as some of my classmates would do .
We can see that as the world gets more complex , to stay away from the lure of so many unnecessary things and keep efficient , it is vital for us to master the knowledge of planning and organizing .
On the other hand , due to the complexity of the world , they should learn to organize in order to be more competitive in the future .
Contrary to doing things in a mess , logically finishing all the tasks will save one a lot of time and energy , leaving him still competitive in coming tasks .
As I planned well for the whole day , I would not make mistakes such as doing things relating to a single subject in a complete morning or afternoon , which would make my head dizzy and I could not focus all my attention on my work .
Instead , I will divide the tasks of a single subject into different parts beforehand , making myself stay conscious all the time .
As a result , I am always able to accept new academic work in my middle school , and this advantage stayed with me through middle school in college .
He casts doubt on the mechanism the article assumed , which suggests that birds ca n't see through the glass would prevent them from bumping into it .
There is a large possibility that the bird would still think of the reflection of the sky as the real one , resulting in a collision with the glass .
The author implies that artists could incorporate some colorful painted patterns , such as lines , into the appearance of the glass buildings .
Last but not least , the article points out a novel mean by creating a magnetic field to guide the birds away from architecture .
The article lists three main disadvantages of communal online encyclopedias , inaccuracy , easy to be attacked by hacks and less of considered view .
Secondly , companies that run the communal online encyclopedias will lock the basic data to protect information from being attacked , and internet experts will be hired by the company to monitor the data in case someone is trying to break the terms .
The conductor will provide the members of the group with information about features of the scenic spots they visit or the background of the historical monuments .
For example , if travelers chose to visit a city that has a long and complicated history such as Xi'an , the guide of the tour would tell them some stories of Terra Cotta Warrior that could help them understand the past of this city .
That is to say , parents know what skills children should need during their lifetime , and children can prepare for their future earlier .
Talented as Gates has been , Gates refused to stay in his comfort zone , but instead ventured into the technology industry to develop something new .
This means parents has faced more difficulties than children , so they can teach their children how to solve the problem by themselves and become independent people in the future .
According to the research conducted by Executive Yuan , the number of children who can participate in the Summer camp in the past quarter has surprisingly soared by about 10 % , a figure that has nearly doubled as against last year .
In fact , the contributing factor lies in the fact that more and more parents start to teach their children about self-care ability .
The article provides three ways to do so , however , the professor does not agree with the passage . She found some means provided by it not feasible and some others may cause unwanted results .
Although fences might be effective to prevent adult toads from passing by , they can not restrict the movements of young toads and eggs .
Since streams usually contain lots of young cane toads and eggs of them , the population can easily build a few months after they were carried to pass national fences .
Untrained volunteers can hardly recognize the differences between native frogs and cane toads , so they might accidentally harm the population of native frogs , leading to an awkward situation .
The author of the article states that a virus designed for cane toads is a perfect solution to ace the toads ' issue in Australia , since none of the other species will be threatened .
Nevertheless , he or she did not notice that the release of the virus in Australia might affect populations of toads in Central and South America , in turn ruin the ecosystem there , since cane toads over there play a crucial role in the ecosystem of America .
In the programming of games and complex financial transitions , it has a unique feature to complete complex but precise calculation . An Encapsulation , An inheritance polymorphism are three features of C++ , and these concepts may be derived from ecological concepts and common nature is consistent with life .
As a result , we can see it is more common that some teenagers master more than one sport or instrument today .
Others may prefer to take part in several activities to broaden their horizons rather than to really master a skill deeply time-consuming .
Actually , I tried more than 20 activities , like dance , tennis , and soccer when I was a kid , so I know I really love some of these activities rather than only one activity .
And something interesting is that I know Najifa from Mohinur because of the opera club they two join while I do n't .
When we three go out for fun , Mohinur and I can teach Najifa to try other simple activities and we all enjoy it .
To begin with , having enough food is the fundamental well-being of the citizen and boosts the other science and technology pops up .
After that , people do not need to be concerned about living and many more people will pursue a higher quality of life .
In modern society , based on enough food supply and cheap food prices , there are more and more organizations and individuals making extra effort in experimental investigations and experiments .
Creating more jobs or posts is only of benefit to the unemployed , which is not the fundamental thing to all workers .
And they are just a small part of society or states which do not have a huge influence on the development of a country .
In addition , there is no doubt that providing more affordable houses will help citizens have fewer financial burdens and it is an effective measure to solve the pressure of housing .
As we all know , real estate is the pillar of the economy for most developing countries and the government sells the land at an extremely high price , which leads to an increase in the cost for the real estate developer .
If the government provides more affordable houses it means they will have less income and the real estate developer may be under attack because they have less opportunity to make money .
Taking into account the evidence above , we can safely come to the conclusion that the best method to make a country better to live in or strong enough is increasing agriculture and lowering the food price by a country leader because the food supply is fundamental to a state or country and enough food makes sure every citizen has a prosperous and secure life .
To be more precise , without using pesticides , not only is it disadvantageous for farmers to compete with others who utilize pesticides in the market , but it will lead to having a lower field consequently .
In the second place , the reading suggests that it can employ the heat to kill the fungus to treat or prevent the frog from infection which is caused by fungus .
What 's more , it is both complex and expensive on account of the fact that it can not pass the resistance to the offspring , they need to use these antifungal medications for each frog 's generation .
Lastly , the reading implies that threatening the habitats of frogs is due to human activities which overutilize the water resources .
For instance , when the temperature is arising , the water of lakes and marshes will evaporate sharply , giving rise to the decline of the frog populations .
The topic raises the controversial issue of whether listening to recorded lectures before class and doing more practice about that is an efficient way to learn .
As far as I am concerned , I agree it is an effective way to preview by listening to recorded lectures before classes .
What impressed me in the classes was that the professor always provided recording and video materials for us to learn fundamental knowledge on our own .
Considering the limited time in classes , the professor strove to teach us more advanced knowledge and gave us more completed contents .
We learned the content that should be taught for two semesters in normal and all of us did great presentations in classes .
The number of students who have grades over 90 in international exams this year has surprisingly soared roughly about 10 percent , a figure that has nearly doubled as against that of last year .
In fact , the contributing factor lies in the fact that with more and more online materials uploaded by teachers , students can handle easier parts of class by themselves and can pay more attention to practicing more difficult parts in classes .
I think it is natural that with increasing exchanges with the west , a lot of western holidays have been gradually introduced into China .
Recently , as all people are focusing more on the environment , the importance of environmental issues is now becoming more significant .
The solutions to those issues are widely discussed and someone proposes that the only way is to force the present generation to adapt to a simpler life .
With the latest theories and the rocketing accumulation of knowledge , scientists own ideal facilities which are exploited as a tool to turn their hypotheses into reality .
Being short-term waited , the latest technologies , designed for a single issue , are able to be used by the public to achieve the goal of saving the environment .
Compared with the long time of simple life , generation by generation , people would only wait for the invention of new technology under this circumstance .
To be more specific , the rate of sapping natural stocks is extremely high , which means forcing people to accept a simple life has little effects on diminishing that rate .
Admittedly , some opponents may think that lowering living standard benefits at least one generation , since more resources could be exploited to maintain their life .
Therefore , we recommend that the transaction subject does not appear as an assuagement before the successful signing , and the strategic partner can transfer part of the equity through subsequent transactions through Jingnengand Panda after this transaction .
Advertisement , an important element of business , has been elaborated on and even triggers heated discussions over whether a company should spend a lot of money on advertising .
Contrary to these people 's opinions it is my perspective that investing more money in advertising is vital to a company , due to its contribution to a both the company 's internal operation and external development .
Initially , advertisements will boost sales as well as increase profits . In detail , there are many people who watch advertisements on television or listen to them on the radio , and they will probably be interested in buying goods when affected by advertisements ; however , consumers can not get enough information and become familiar with the goods when they can not watch or listen to advertisements . Moreover , advertisements encourage employees to work with enthusiasm . To explain it deeper , with more advertising investment , people will pay more attention to the company , thus employees will feel proud of their work and be more enthusiastic ; .
Specifically , public advertisements will increase visibility and a large number of applicants from good companies are willing to apply for it because of good remuneration and environment ; on the contrary , a company without advertisements is not attractive to candidates because candidates will feel that the company does not have sufficient funds and thus they will not have a good salary .
To explain it further , a brand increases its popularity through advertising and is praised by the outside world , and investors are willing to invest to make more money ; in contrast , if a company 's brand is not well-known , it can not attract investment from home and abroad .
In contrast to the writer 's idea that the stones are pushed by the wind , the professor states that the wind does not have enough power .
He/she advanced this theory by saying that the stones leave deep grooves in the ground , which can show that moving stones will meet a lot of resistance , because they 're being pushed through the mud rather than just sliding or rolling on the surface .
The professor continues to discredit the writing 's argument that the formation of ice can move the stones , by examining the fact that the Death Valley can not form large and thick ice to move the stones .
Second , temperatures can fall below freezing at night , but rise during the day , so temperatures usually do n't stay below freezing long enough for the ice sheet to be thick enough to capture and carry rocks .
It is the professor 's third argument that there is no evidence that people move them , which contradicts the view of the writer that the sailing stones may seem like a perfect practical joke .
To explore deeper , the professor says that researchers have yet to find human footprints , or those of beasts of burden , like horses , that can drag stones .
Since we can see from the grooves of the stones that they sometimes move during muddy times , it is impossible for anyone to move the stones without leaving their tracks .
However , after the director and playwright 's condensation , a movie is usually 2 hours long and tells most of the story in the book .
Second , watching the movie first seems a better choice because people can see nice-looking actors and actresses in the movie , which makes people happy .
Just because we see the normal pallet jack may cause harder work it 's necessary to use an electric type as the replacement .
In today 's society , many parents believe that reading assigned by the teacher could help their child gain good grades in their exams , and then help them gain good opportunities to attend good universities , which leads susceptible people to neglect the importance of reading on their own .
In terms of the children 's thoughts and their abilities to deal with different kinds of things , I strongly and firmly believe that reading on their own is more important than reading assigned by their teachers .
Those books assigned by teachers always merely include information about students ' tests which are usually already taught by their teachers .
As a result , not only do children receive the information they only need to remember , which limits their thoughts , but also sometimes the information is not what students want .
In contrast , by reading on their own , students could find something they are interested in such as some astronomy books , biology books , or even music books , which evidently could provide them with better opportunities to get a good job , since they will know a lot of different things .
My cousin , Jason , reading different books since he was very young , especially astronomy books , is used to staying in a quiet place , thinking by himself , not to mention his studying ability , the ability to gather information and to summarize gained by reading based on his interest .
Admittedly , those books teachers assign can help students to get a good grade . However , there are too many things students need to learn , such as how to deal with the relationship between people , when they face some challenges how they deal with it , and so forth .
We need to admit that teachers , from time to time , are not able to recognize students ' needs , and only students themselves know what they want or lack .
In a nutshell , I maintain that , for students , reading on their own is more important than reading the materials assigned by teachers , as long as children 's thoughts , their job opportunities , and their abilities are concerned .
Although some people may oppose me , as my favorite quote from John Wilson `` man continues fallible '' , I believe that they will compromise after being exposed to my article .
The author suggests that in order to reduce cheating among students , all colleges and universities should adopt an honor code similar to Groveton 's .
The average cheating per year is thirty under the original system while it is less than twenty-one after adopting an honor code , hence the author believes the honor code is an efficacious method to reduce cheating .
The result of a recent survey shows that most students would be less likely to cheat within an honor code in place .
Before we accept this fact , we need to know whether the participants are selected at random and the sample size to evaluate the statistical reliability of this survey .
If the survey is only conducted among a small proportion of students or some specific classes , the result may contain bias , therefore , it is not representative enough to reflect the general attitude of all students .
Granted that adopting an honor code has successfully reduced cheating in Groveton College , there is no guarantee that it will work as well in other colleges and universities .
It is possible that some schools have very different situations from Groveton College before adopting an honor code , so there may be disparate outcomes .
For example , if most students are used to cheating in another school , that 's to say most students do not consider cheating a disgrace .
The author of the argument claims that the best strategy to save money is to return to Buzzoff for all pest control services .
The memo cited the past data that $ 20000 worth of food had been destroyed in Palm City with the control service provided by Fly-Away Pest Control Company last month , while $ 10000 in Wintervale with the control service provided by Buzzoff Pest Control Company .
However , the assumption here is that the results of the two cities could be compared without pest control services .
However , if Fly-Away Pest Control Company reduced the cost of destroyed food from $ 100000 to $ 20000 while Buzzoff Pest Control Company reduced it only from $ 10050 to $ 10000 , it is obvious that the service of Fly-Away Pest Control Company is the better one .
However , to assess the best way to save money , we must take the cost of the service into consideration rather than only think about the money that could be reduced .
For example , if the cost of service provided by Buzzoff Pest Control Company is $ 1000000 while the cost of Fly-Away Pest Control Company is only $ 1 , the Fly-Away Pest Control Company would be the better choice .
Even if the Buzzoff Pest Control Company achieves a better result in Wintervale , an assumption here is that their method to control pests could be equivalently effective in Palm City .
The pest control service of Buzzoff Pest Control Company could become feckless and even poorer than the one provided by the Fly-Away Pest Control Company .
The passage and the lecture are both about whether pterosaurs were capable of powered flight , which involves flapping wings flying .
First , the author points out that since pterosaurs were probably cold-blooded animals as modern reptiles are cold-blooded as well , it is very likely that pterosaurs would not have the ability to produce enough energy to fly .
The speaker , on the other hand , mentions that pterosaurs have a dense and hair-like covering on their body , which is a trait possessed by warm-blooded animals . Therefore , she believes that pterosaurs were warm-blooded and they have a faster metabolism to generate enough energy to fly .
Second , it is mentioned by the author that pterosaurs were large in size and were probably heavy in weight , so it is unlikely that pterosaurs were able to flap their wings fast enough to be airborne .
Third , the author mentions that , from the study of the fossilized bones of pterosaurs , pterosaurs did not have strong back leg muscles to run fast or to jump to fly .
Studies show that pterosaurs walk or run with four legs , allowing them to run fast enough and jump into the air to fly .
With the ubiquity of televisions , people tend to have a general idea of the world by watching TV news every day .
Some people , however , still believe that reading newspapers is the best way to get to know the news around the world because TVs can not provide them with enough information to help them comprehend the things that were happening .
At first , TVs always provide us with the visible and audible version of the news , which helps us to know the reality or seriousness of the news .
When reading newspapers , people can just imagine the real picture of the news by reading those words and portraying those scenes in their minds . So in many cases , they fail to show themselves the reality of the news .
For example , I read about the war in Syria in newspapers at first , so I did n't recognize the seriousness of this war .
I just thought it was a normal civil war in Syria , and it would cease in a few weeks by negotiating , but when I turned on the TV , everything changed .
I stared at the TV and heard the hopeless crying of a baby sitting in the ruins . Those sounds make me despair .
Only when I saw the desperate scenes and heard the cry of hopelessness on the TV could I comprehend the seriousness and urgency of the crisis happening in Syria .
In newspapers , people can hardly read some contradictory opinions in one passage , but on TV , they can hear some completely opposite views at one time .
When I read the newspapers , the passages in them always told me that because of the intervention of the USA , the situation in Syria had become so horrible .
They detailed their understanding of the war , and the debate between the experts from the USA and Russia let me know the complexity of the situation in Syria , which is much more complicated than only interfering with the USA .
Because of the rich resources in the Middle East , many other countries wanted to be involved in it and permeate their influences , which I did not know when reading the passages in newspapers .
In general , by seeing the real pictures and hearing the real sound , and plus listening to different opinions debated on TV , people will have a much more comprehensive understanding .
When it comes to the ways to improve health conditions , some citizens claim that the kind of food they eat and the amount of stress are more important than the amount of exercise , while others argue that the amount of exercise is their priority .
However , the pupils also face more difficulties obtaining outstanding college certifications because most students have started learning when they were young .
What 's more , most exercises are team games , so students can make a lot of friends from exercise , such as basketball or baseball games .
When the young encounter arduous situations , they can search for help from friends who they realize from exercise ; thus , it must reduce their pressure .
There were plenty of hard-working employees who died because of working for long hours on the news because of their stressful lifestyle .
But from my perspective , I believe taking part in an internship at a company to learn some business skills is more necessary for students during the final semester in terms of accumulating work experience and being helpful for finding a job after graduation .
First , the process of learning business skills during the internship could help students gain more work experience which has a profound effect on students ' future development .
After these , students not only would learn business skills that they could n't get from university but also accumulate experience in how to deal with some problems besides professional areas such as personal networks .
Before I graduate , I have n't any work experience because the last semester was the only period that students had time to take an internship .
Therefore , when I began working , I found I was uncompetitive with my peers because without business skills and accumulation of work experience .
Second , taking part in an internship not only could learn business skills but also be helpful for students to find a formal job after graduation .
As we all know , companies tend to hire students who have work experience because it would reduce the cultivation cost .
Before graduating , appropriately taking part in an internship could help students apply their professional skills and research experience in their work better .
So , students need the opportunity to play their skills in work rather than intensive research projects even though the topics are interesting .
The residential theory argues that there are houses in the Chaco structures , and the structure is big enough for hundreds of people .
The professor tells us that there are few fireplaces in the structure , this truth is in contradiction with the huge size of the houses .
To begin with , the reading mentions that this book was written by a prominent physician , who was favorable to complete this complicated mission because he owned similar illustrations on his other products .
Secondly , the writer suggests that those texts did not include useful meaning , given that the potential inventor was Edward , who was a noticeable deceiver in the past . He usually faked those messages into supernatural powers and extracted money from rich celebrities .
Yet , the speaker defends that this behavior did not make sense , on account Edward operating such intricate work was impractical , people who lived in the sixteenth century were fooled easily by simple tricks .
That is , instead of requiring him to finish those strenuous jobs , he was able to pursue the same purpose with many more primitive methods .
Lastly , the author implies that the manuscript was made by a recent book dealer , who wanted to sell this book with appealing offers .
While the lecture argues that according to modern means , the ink and the paper revealed that those substances have existed for four hundred years . So even though Voynich could discover antique papers , he will fail to figure out the ancient ink .
At the beginning of 2015 , Uber prices were higher than traditional taxis , just a few months ago while the market expanded and the price of rides became lower than taxis .
Therefore , traditional taxis lost their markets , and one-third of taxi drivers join Uber because in the traditional taxi industry , if you want to become a taxi driver , you should get medallions and it might cost 1 million dollars in New York .
Now , customers using smartphones to order a trip are overtaking the traditional taxi service in terms of rides per day . This directly constitutes a full-blown crisis for the taxi industry .
My dream is to be a scientist who researches chemistry or biology . Because I think chemistry , biology , and physics , these subjects are the basis of things .
But for now , I think learning English is an urgent affair , so my first goal for the future is to improve my English skills .
Last summer vacation , my cousin Bob complained to me that after moving to a new city , he ca n't make new friends easily with local students .
New friends can provide students with help in their daily lives , and help them know something about the issues that need to be cared for , thus people can adapt to their new life more easily .
By contrast , if people only maintain their past friendship , these friends can not provide them with any help in their new lives , so they have to try every aspect of the new place and adapt to the new circumstance slowly .
When people make new friends , they can recognize the different cultures during their daily lives , since there may be some different diets or mother tongues .
Whereas the people who cling to their present friends would never be able to step out of their comfort zone and absorb nutrients from different cultures .
If people choose new friends , they may not be able to provide them with as much care as their old friends can give them .
In conclusion , the ability to make new friends can help people accommodate a new environment , expand their horizons , and get more practical help .
As some might think that celebrities are equally important to people of all ages , I think young people actually pay more attention to celebrities .
First , most teenagers are not mature enough and are easily affected by celebrities , we can see lots of children imitate the behaviors of pop stars .
I often see her dressing like Elsa , an anime character from the movie Frozen , and trying to act like she is a princess .
Hence , as young people are not mature enough , they are more easily affected by celebrities and hence celebrities are more important to them .
Secondly , as old people are busy and have no spare time to spend caring about what celebrities are doing , they will not think celebrities are important to them .
He thinks it is ridiculous to spend time keeping track of famous people 's movements as they will have no positive impact on our lives .
Therefore , as most old people think keeping track of famous people 's lives is useless , we can imply that celebrities are less important to them .
Last but not least , as the target audiences of celebrities such as singers or actors are young people , their behaviours will be more attractive to young people .
My father , again , can not understand why this kind of music could become popular and actually thinks this kind of music is annoying .
Hence , as older people are not the target audiences of most celebrities , they will not think famous people are important to them .
Hence , since young people are more easily attracted by celebrities as older people have no time and are not the target audience of celebrities , I think celebrities are more important to older people .
I deeply understand that for those who have struggled with food and clothing at the bottom of their lives , what they desire most is a peaceful life with food and clothing .
The waiter who soaked his hands in the sink for more than ten hours in the restaurant , the cleaners who started sweeping the street at 4 o'clock in the cold winter , the salesmen who stood on the street and kept handing out flyers ... There were people in various living conditions in society , and I told them people who live hard with their own hands are worthy of our respect .
We must believe that life will never fail those who are upright and kind and hard-working , and happiness will definitely knock on the door .
It is always a dilemma for parents whether they should let their children play video games and how frequently they can play .
Some people think that it is a bad idea , while others believe that this can be the best way for kids to learn .
To be more precise , people learn more effectively when they want to learn , no matter if they are kids or adults .
They will resist learning it and start to hate it , even if the subject that he is learning is what he likes in the first place .
Even though they were just some pretty ordinary games compared to others , they still made a kid like me start to be enthusiastic about learning English .
Yet , there are a lot of products that can protect children 's eyes , and of course , teachers and parents will have to make sure they do not spend too much time on them .
First of all , companies find people who have already used the product and pretty much like it to be a buzzer . This is why the company recruits him ; nevertheless , the buzzer does not lie to consumers .
Secondly , consumers will ask lots of questions before they buy , so it does not seem they always believe whatever is true .
The answer in my mind is that Othello is the protagonist . Because the name of the book is Othello . Everyone respected him . He has convincing power and he is the only black noble in the story .
He was promoted to general of the Venetian army because of his command of the brutal war with the Turks , and his position was so high that he was respected and trusted by his country .
When Othello is telling the truth that all the senator seems willing to listen to Othello , they want him to say something valuable to them .
The reason why Othello became a hero is not only his magnanimity , simplicity , natural frankness , and other charming nature , but also the most important factor . that he has the same heart and sense of responsibility as his career .
The combination of Desdemona and Othello is the combination of `` beauty '' and `` black '' , which will naturally `` attract insults and defamation '' .
In act 1 , Lago wants to harm Othello because he told Brabantio about the secret marriage of Othello , but then Othello had Brabantio 's consent the senators respect .
In short , Othello , as a black man , in order to obtain the recognition of the white aristocracy , braved danger , fought on the battlefield , achieved outstanding achievements , and finally became a marshal in command of the army .
It is a general consensus that parents play crucial roles in the children 's growing process , yet I do not consider parents to be the best teachers for us .
Some parents demand too much from their children owing to high expectations , which will make their children feel plenty of stress .
Other parents are too lenient since they wish their children `` happy '' , and are responsible for their children doing anything they are fond of , which is likely to lead their children to be lazy or escape everything they are not preferencing ; consequently , perhaps they may lose lots of opportunities to absorb various knowledge .
Moreover , even if parents are willing to solve any kind of problem when their children are facing a lot of ordeals , children still do not regard their parents as the priority in seeking help .
Take my experience , for instance , when I feel upset , I am prone to sharing my worry with my friend , as I do not want to increase my parents ' irritation , furthermore , parents are likely to regard tiny things as serious questions .
Thus , by learning from excel one can not only reduce mistakes or misleading but also absorb the best tip of learning methods .
Additionally , the professional one can provide learners with new knowledge or observations in the specific facet , not like the parents who just tell the knowledge they studied before .
In a nutshell , based on the arguments mentioned above , even if the importance of parents ' teaching can not be overemphasized , children still hard to look upon parents as the best teachers .
Some people say that children living in the present time spend too much time using smartphones , playing online games , and surfing social websites .
First of all , children should emphasize their studies , but spending time on smartphones can lessen their efficiency in studying .
For example , when children spend a lot of time on smartphones before midterm exams , they will not have enough time to read .
For instance , if children play online games that contain some unsuitable content such as guns , drugs , or sex , they usually take the virtual world as reality and then emerge wrong behavior .
However , the friend on the internet was a bad guy then he raped this child when they date in the reality .
Then when I was a middle school student , I was interested in Judo , which was one of my favorite sports in my life .
Many of my Chinese classmates often make jokes to say I 'm not a Chinese person because I always eat western food rather than Chinese food .
The article claims that it remains a mystery whether bees existed on Earth 200 million years ago , because of the uncertainty of the creators of the fossil structures found that resemble bee nests .
While the lecture shows the opposite view that it is quite possible for bees to survive 200 million years ago for several reasons .
To begin with , the article means hardly any fossils of actual bees were found that dated back to 200 million years ago , the earliest of which was 100 million years old .
While the lecture repudiates it by suggesting that the lack of fossils dating back to 200 million years ago may be due to the inability to preserve them .
Second , the article says there is a close relationship between bees and flower plants that first appeared only 125 million years ago .
On the contrary , the lecture casts doubt on it that the bee initially may feed on other plants like pine trees .
Although the fossil structures found do have no caps possessing a spiral pattern , on the other hand , the lecture denies this claim by showing that there are some similarities between the waterproof chemicals of the fossil and those used by modern bees .
Education-oriented technological devices , including OHPs , interactive whiteboards , PCs , and tablets , are prevalent in almost every primary school classroom across the nation , which allows students to have access to these tools for the learning of subject content and the completion of schoolwork or assignments .
One of the benefits of making an electronic gadget handy to students is that they can enjoy some tailor-made learning experience , thus improving their learning performance at school .
With thousands of education and tutoring applications in those e-learning tools such as Apple iPads and Microsoft Surface Pro , teachers can select level- and content-appropriate courses to satisfy individual students ' learning needs besides what is required in the teaching syllabus .
To be more specific , for some low achievers who may have problems with correct word pronunciation , using specific apps would make it possible to be exposed to the right language context and develop their ability to imitate and produce the expected sound .
For example , Lilian , my little cousin and a 10-year-old student in a local elementary school used to find it challenging to finish her math assignments about multiplication .
This problem was gradually solved after she kept doing practice tasks on her iPad using 'Mathodology ' , an app providing six-level interactive exercises with detailed feedback , recommended by her math teacher .
In addition , the opportunity to use technological tools allows young students to develop learning autonomy , which would enormously benefit their future learning in upper grades .
For example , tablets with certain technological features give learners the ability to highlight and edit texts and write notes during their learning process .
If they are confused with any words and concepts , they could simply consult the built-in dictionary and use the search engines developed by Baidu or Google to take advantage of the multi-entry result pages on the Internet .
With relevant skills like information searching , analyzing , and evaluating sharpened , they step by step adopt a new role of a self-directed and self-regulated independent learner , and this helps better their performance throughout the rest of the school years in the K-12 period and the whole tertiary education stage or above .
Belonging to the Z Generation , I , in Year 3 , started to get access to a laptop , on which I read e-books and learnt to do research before completing school projects and other assignments .
The mastery of web-based research skills became a stepping stone toward my academic success later in high school and now in college .
In conclusion , with the fact that technology is made readily accessible to young students comes the possibility for them to enjoy personalized learning in the short term and learning independence in the long run .
As human beings have kept developing plenty of industries , we have been utilizing different environments for a long period ; therefore , is it more prominent to procure valuable resources from the ecosystem rather than protecting settings that surround us closely ?
Some people contend that those lands can afford adequate sustenance for the massive population widely , while others advocate that we have the responsibility to preserve those wonderful landscapes .
To begin with , preserving the surroundings will cultivate the possibility of potential sources , given that we possess an eco-friendly cycle that is able to discover indispensable articles .
In other words , with those positive behaviors , humans can own a clean and fresh Earth no matter now or in the future .
For example , people who live in cities suffer from air pollution and rising temperatures continuously , modern constructions and abundant vehicles are fulfilled with our daily lives , because we have those formations which highly constrain our ability to contact nature , so those disastrous machines may destroy the ecosystem eventually .
On the contrary , if we choose to behave conductively toward our environment , such as recycling , reducing electricity , taking part in public transportation and so on , we can retain much more energy and power on the planet and own the caliber to unearth essential items .
What is more , when we conserve the setting instead of building a myriad of configurations , bustling people 's mental health will be enhanced properly , granted that they can find an appropriate pattern to relax .
According to recent statistics , there is ample coverage demonstrating that humans who inhabit the hub continually will undergo severe conditions due to the dirty air and stressful surroundings .
Admittedly , viewing from the opposite perspective , certain people may claim that it is more persuasive to offer enough food for the rising growth of the generation , due to the fact that we manipulate all species in the world .
Those who bolster the idea might indicate that this operation either is much more advantageous for people 's survival or spend less time gathering various materials efficiently .
In the long term , we require ourselves to stay balanced with fauna and flora , because only through these relationships can people sustain precious lives constantly , and we can not deploy our surroundings with serious destruction , this mechanism will occur in far more irregular circumstances in the future .
To limit the transmission of potential positive risks of viruses , telemedicine services seem to be a safe option to have regular health checkups during the quarantine .
Some people tend to think that organizing rooms neatly will have a higher chance of succeeding , but I disagree with this .
There is a study that shows that a comfortable and familiar environment can help people improve about 20 percent efficiency during work .
The reason for some modern people whose room is chaos and mass is not caused by laziness rather than over workload .
Although there are some benefits for people to cultivate a habit of cleaning rooms , it does n't have any direct relationship to succeeding .
For example , Ford invented the assembly line to help Ford company achieve advantages in the competition , Jobs reverse the pattern of technological devices , Facebook make telecommuting possible , and so on .
Without innovation in time , the company can only provide the same product and service and earn a little profit or even make a loss .
In science , professors who want to explore some unknown field and unravel some mystery need to work hard by doing thousands of experiments , recording the data , comparing the difference of variety , and getting conclusions .
Mentioned in your answer that the researchers can `` observe how the same person behaves in the same situation before and after drinking coffee '' is a very interesting point .
Researchers should not only collect data through participants ' self-reports , but also observe their specific behaviors ( or expressions , such as facial muscles ' performance ) to help quantify their happiness index .
This , of course , raises the question of what kind of behavior is defined as a state of happiness ( at least we know that frowning , drooping corners of eyes and mouth are absolutely not the expressions for happiness ) .
Does that mean I have to wait for two weeks later then submit an approval again , or I might have a privilege ( cuz I still have all the accounts for the course ) ?
Some people may argue as if it is a general truth that working on the projects assigned by the teacher independently will help students learn much more efficiently .
There are numerous reasons which can be used to counter such assertion , and I will point out a few primary ones here .
The main problem with this argument is that it is ignorant of the basic fact that independent learners tend to have less communication with others , as a result , makes it difficult for them to learn useful skills that can not be discovered by themselves .
Working in a group will encourage everyone engaged to spare all their effort to find problems , and propose strategies to solve problems .
By such procedure , for example , an individual who is not good at problem thinking will learn how to initiate his thoughts by learning from ones who are good at thinking in the same group .
Another reason why I disagree with the statement is that I believe working together can cut down redundant work by optimizing the advantages of different members .
Since projects can be divided into parts and assigned to different members who are good at solving corresponding problems , every member can play a significant role in the project to their advantage without caring about what they can not do .
With their help , I could focus on modeling simulation without worrying about my poor coding ability , and consequently , we won the first prize due to our sagacious strategy .
What is more , I oppose such an argument that corporation is a critical skill for students to achieve success in the future and projects in university can enhance their corporation ability .
Students will have a deep understanding of how to communicate with others efficiently , and how to utilize everyone 's talent before they encounter real-life challenges in the future .
Sue , one of my seniors , was the captain of the debate team at my university and was well-known for her enthusiasm for corporations since she could give her teammate appropriate advice in time .
She was admitted to Harvard for her great achievement in a debate and now she is working on a big project on a psychological topic with her professors .
In a word , working together on a project is beneficial to the students in the development of different abilities on campus and also in pursuit of a successful future .
To alleviate the stress of freshmen , universities usually arrange a one-week orientation for them to get familiar with the campus or arrange a student of their major in higher grades to help them .
To begin with , the orientation week starting before the term will not occupy students ' time for classes and other social activities .
The first challenge in college that freshmen have to confront is getting used to different professors ' different ways of giving lectures .
Unlike classes in high school , some of the courses in college are given to hundreds of students , and professors cover many chapters during the two-hour course and assign lots of homework per week .
Another challenge before freshmen is to meet new friends in class , get along well with new roommates , and enrich campus life by joining clubs .
Unavoidably , all students will feel uneasy when they arrive in a new environment , especially when they find classes that they will attend are more difficult and demanding .
For example , senior students who have already taken many courses can offer a lot of valuable information to professors , reference books , assignments , and exams .
Though freshmen without that valuable advice may come across an array of obstacles that cost them much time to overcome , discourage them , or even fail them , they will finally be rewarded with the improvement of ability and confidence when they solve problems one by one independently .
To sum up , to help freshmen get accustomed to campus life , universities ought to arrange the orientation week before the term starts instead of assigning them to be senior students .
First , the article claims that elephants can be aware of the end of their lives and will go to elephant graveyards alone .
That is , trainers can stroke the ears of elephants to train elephants to do some tricks including repeating draw brush strokes that trainers teach .
The argument concludes that since the fraction of students protesting against proposed cuts in funding for various state college programs is relatively small , the state legislature is not necessary to heed the appeals of the protesting students .
What first underlies the author 's thinking as the major assumption is that those students who did not travel to the state capital building are indifferent to the issue .
Since the state capital building might be far from Waymarsh State College , some students who were also against the proposed cuts in funding did not have the time to travel or protest , they might be busy with their studies or staying with their families .
Moreover , the cost of travelling may be high and some students who do not have a part-time job might not have enough money to cover the costs .
Thus , it might end up with only a small proportion of students being able to travel to the state capital building to take part in the protest .
To make the argument more plausible , the author should conduct a survey among those who did not protest to find out how many of them are also against the proposed cuts in funding for state college programs .
It is also presumed in the argument that the decrease in funding for a variety of state college programs will only affect the students from Waymarsh State College .
Since there are usually a large number of state colleges in a certain state , the cuts in funding for state college programs may affect far more than the only 12200 students from Waymarsh State College .
Perhaps , there may be a larger proportion of students who intend to protest about the issue but are not adequately prepared since they are busy with their final tests .
It is likely that not all students against the proposal can actually protest in the state capital building and that the students from Waymarsh State College may not be representative of all the students in the state who are also involved in this issue .
Thus , before reaching any conclusions , the author should conduct more research and surveys about the opinion of those students who did not protest and those from other state colleges .
But there is a fact being ignored by the passage that the areas of the surrounding are no longer meeting the requirement , since the climate change in the large region is overwhelming the microclimate .
If moving from fields into the research center , diversity can not take place , which means it still suffers from the threat of disease .
Tourism , in some sense , has become the top heated discussion among modern citizens , and thus people choose places to go carefully .
Nowadays , many people think to lure more tourists , the government should repair old buildings and streets , because people are willing to visit someplace beautiful .
The research compiled by the Sociology Department of Peking University shows that 66 % of people think they would be unlikely to go to a destination if an accident happened there .
So , securing the safety of visitors is the primary issue that the government should deal with , for without entire safety , it is possible that some accidents may happen , which may have a negative influence on local reputation .
And it is quite apparent that recruiting more police is an easy and direct way to get a high level of safety .
On the contrary , although improving its appearance can more or less make the city attractive , people may no longer go without a safe and relaxed environment .
Another fundamental perspective we should not overlook is that not only can policemen eliminate violent things such as fighting and arguments , but also they can offer a sense of security and comfort .
For example , my friends and I lost our way when we visited Shanghai , a modern city in China , then we called the police .
Even if we did not meet any big troubles , we still thought the behavior of those policemen made us feel warm and we tended to go there when we had another chance , for we had a favorable experience there .
Visitors , sometimes , do not care about whether the place is beautiful , and what they care about is whether they can have a safe and pleasant tour there .
In conclusion , after weighing all the related factors , I am determined that improving safety by hiring more police is the most effective .
Lifestyle change is something really significant for us humans . It is bound to bring some important things out , and some objects become necessities , then comes the changing of production structure .
I noticed that when this topic is under discussion , people mostly might say the cleaner the better , or we deserve it like transmigration and retribution .
So instead of repeating how terrible the calamity we create , I would like to take advantage of this duty to emphasize the critical facts we are facing and what we can do to protect the environment .
Those catastrophes caused by earth movements like earthquakes and tsunamis are the inevitable group while others , for instance , pestilent and pollution are avoidable to a certain degree .
Sorry to say that there are not any procedures in environmental protection afoot on a national level because tons of issues are engaged .
For instance , some butchers and hurters subsist on the bat , the source of SARS and coronavirus , and proscribing eating bats will cut their income entirely .
Factories in developing countries release waste gas directly into the air and conduct nocuous effluvia to the sea , river , and ocean .
Sadly , people are not taking those speeches seriously , for someone think that she is manipulated by politicians , as an icon of the next generation .
From this drama , what we should learn is we are the generation that should take the responsibility to save our Earth .
We have to admit that ebooks are encroaching on the book market from traditional printed books when more and more books provided by Amazon are available to read online at a very tempting price .
So the customer can spend a fraction of the cost of the printed book to read the same content with their mobile phone .
To build a cozy reading environment , Kindle , a hardware and software mixed system , was developed by the company so that you can download the ebook and read it with a special ink screen .
In this circumstance , you just need a few steps to find the definition of that word and that will help to enhance the foreign language reading ability since there is no interruption to reading .
Readers can emerge in that magical world by browsing it on their iPad , for this version inserted moving pictures next to the paragraphs just like what is presented in the movie .
However , you can just highlight the sentence with an Apple pencil just like using a marker on a piece of paper .
In conclusion , with the growth of technology , ebooks will certainly become a substitute for printed books and will soon overthrow the way we read .
Without a doubt , the Internet impacted society significantly , but whether it has a positive or negative influence still remains a controversial issue that is debated by scholars and professors .
However , I personally believe that the Internet positively impacts our life , simply because it allows us to know about events happening around the world .
My personal experience clearly demonstrates how important it is to know and learn from events that have happened around the world .
However , since I was well prepared and learned from previous instances , I was able to maintain a normal life and had little impact .
Even if those events do n't really involve our daily lives , we improve ourselves and become better people by learning from those events and making use of them .
Back when Tom was in middle school , he had a narrow perspective on life and tended to live in his whole world .
Consequently , after a few weeks , I surprisingly found out that he had become a man of wisdom , and also skilled in the ability to brainstorm through distinctive aspects of a particular issue .
In conclusion , I am of the opinion that it is more than important to know about events around the world even if they may not affect our daily life .
This is simply because we can be well prepared if they occur to ourselves , and there 's a lot to learn from those events .
Another challenge is to meet new friends in class , get along well with new roommates , and enrich campus life by joining clubs .
We are all very stressed because we must hand in our homework every day and we need to get good grades on every test .
I am always spending the whole night studying in order to hand in the homework on time and make progress in my studies .
As a result , I can not find time to learn about society or do things like volunteer work that will certainly help me to understand more about the world around me .
Some of the rules are so strict that they make young people unable to bring a certain kind of convenience to their lives .
However , I find it very inconvenient to obey the rule because sometimes I need to send messages to my parents about the sudden change in my schedule or the solutions to certain problems .
I always need to borrow others ' phones , and if there is no one who has a phone around me , I will need to try other solutions and it often costs me a lot of time .
If I were planning to choose to donate my money to an organization that provides food and housing to people in need , an organization that gives people money to start their own small business or an organization that provides medical care to people in need , I would say , an organization that gives people money to start their own small business .
A lot of people these days have extraordinary talent . However , if they are not with monetary assistance , their talent might be constrained ; on the other hand , if they have sufficient money to support them , helping them to start their own business , they will be allowed to earn money via their talent , and their talent may be carried out to the greatest extent .
Furthermore , it is possible that their talents show up so well that they push the field of their talent onto a greater level .
Lastly , if money were donated to an organization that provides food and housing to people in need or an organization that provides medical care to people in need , they may eventually fall too dependent on the donation and fail to strive for themselves , for the sake that , they know even they put in no effort , they will end up being assisted by others .
Therefore , it is not a preferable choice to donate money to either an organization that provides food and housing to people in need or an organization that provides medical care to people in need .
To conclude , if I were to donate my money to a charitable organization , among the three choices , I prefer an organization that gives people money to start their own small businesses .
But from my perspective , I believe that physical exercise is more needed for the young in terms of physical and psychological health .
Some people think old people need more exercise , but the truth of the matter is that in this competitive society , young people are suffering huge stress from work .
They spend so much time on various tasks and stay at their workspace all day , which makes them become sub-healthy such as being fat .
So , they really need to take some physical exercise in their spare time , adequate exercise not only could make people avoid the unhealthy condition brought by long time work but also be helpful to increase work efficiency .
In today 's society , young people are regarded to carry the burden of responsibility such as caring for the older and children , and they would feel weighed down under the fearsome load of duty and obligation .
In this case , appropriate physical exercise is helpful for young people to ease their negative minds because taking exercise could produce a complex chemical substance that can make people feel happy and relaxed .
Although both old people and young people all need to exercise , physical exercise is more important for the young than the old .
To begin with , the writer in the reading claims that replacing the regular glass with one-way glass is a great method to prevent injuries to birds since birds can not see through a window and think it is a solid barrier .
However , the professor argues that one-way glass is a terrible idea since the outside surface of the window would reflect like a mirror .
What is more , the writer in the article thinks that painting glass with colorful lines would be a great solution since birds would see stripes and thereby avoid flying through the glass .
Last but not least , the writer makes the statement that generating artificial magnetic fields can help birds steer away from the glass .
On the contrary , the professor challenges the idea by saying that birds only use magnetic fields to navigate when they move a long distance like traveling from cold places to warm places .
Actually , when they move a short distance such as going from one side of the city to another side , they use light or brightness .
Both the lecture and the article address whether wood companies are likely to implement new policies in order to meet ecological sustainability .
While the reading passage indicates that wood firms in America would not follow the trend of eco-certification , the listening holds contrasting opinions based on three aspects .
To begin with , the author mentions that American consumers are skeptical and indifferent toward advertisements , which means they would not value it if a wood company had an eco-certification label .
Generally , people are more optimistic about individual agencies such as wood companies , and thus they would definitely favor companies that have international reputations with eco-certification .
According to the writer , another barrier to eco-certifying wood is the high expenditure of gaining the certification from an official agency , which leads to dissatisfaction of customers since they need to pay higher for eco-certified woods .
Finally , objecting to the passage 's notion that no companies would care about the significance of eco-certification abroad since most American wood companies sell domestically , the professor contends that this could cause US companies to lag behind other international companies .
However , most of the students prefer having more time doing sports or having interesting activities instead of sitting in the classrooms .
From my perspective , I strongly agree with the statement that sports and social activities are as important as classes and libraries and should get equal financial support .
For example , when I was an exchange student in the Netherlands , my university built a sports center where every student could go and choose many types of sport class , not only basketball , soccer , or gym but also yoga and Zumba dance classes .
In conclusion , in order to have a wonderful and healthy student life , I am of the opinion that both sports and social activities are equally important as classes and libraries .
The biggest advantage of the two-step method is that each step is based on the ionosphere-free model for ambiguity resolution to protect it from being influenced by a potential ionospheric anomaly .
I agree with the statement that 'the ability to maintain long-term friendships with a small number of people matters more than the ability to make many new friends easily . ' Friends can be so important to a person because they gave you strength and power .
They were capable of your bottom line , that is to say , they knew perfectly well what things made you angry or what things made you feel good .
When I was staying in the hospital waiting for surgeries , my best friend came to the hospital and took care of me .
Since my parents needed to work , every morning and afternoon , she stayed in the hospital and tried to encourage me .
It 's clear that long-term friendship is much more reliable and the ability to maintain such kinds of relationships is more critical .
For this reason , the ability to maintain long-term friendships with a small number of people matters more than the ability to make many new friends easily .
Drawing from my own experience , if I was having dinner with my closest friend , they skipped the food that contains coriander , because they knew that I hate coriander , and they would also skip peanuts because they knew that I was allergic to peanuts .
It 's certainly clear to see why the ability to maintain long-term friendships with a small number of people matters more than the ability to make many new friends easily .
In light of the above-mentioned reasons , I strongly believe that the ability to maintain long-term friendships with a small number of people matters more than the ability to make many new friends easily .
Since people treat education much more important than before , parents are likely to create some new methods to encourage their children to become more passionate about studying .
Recently , the phenomenon that parents give their children money as a reward for getting high grades in school has caused wide public concern .
Some people indicate that it will change children 's opinion on studying , making them believe only money is the purpose of studying .
However , I contend that giving money to children as a reward is a good choice , a choice that matters weigh its drawbacks .
When children get feedback on their hard work , studying will become a happy job instead of just a boring duty .
We can not refute that sometimes studying could be really boring , doing a lot of exercises , reading passages , and working out math problems .
Another reason that drives me to indicate is that financial thinking is an important ability , which is useful to modern people , meaning that we need to teach our children how to manage their own money .
Admittedly , it is unwise to give much money once a time when children get a good mark since the children will seek only money during their studies .
However , if we make sure that children will not misunderstand the meaning of the reward and keep a healthy attitude toward the money .
Judging from what I 've mentioned above , I should reinforce my perspective that it is good for parents to give their children money as a reward .
The topic raises a controversial issue of which method mentioned in it is the best way to solve the problems of finding jobs .
That is to say , those who have work experience can give you advice immediately and also they can tell you what points you should pay attention to .
By listening to his father 's advice , Gates not only learned how to solve problems independently when finding jobs but also started to plan for his future career .
His story proves to us that asking those people who already had work experience can help us to solve problems when finding jobs .
That is to say , sending emails to companies will spend people lots of time waiting for feedback , and also there is lots of information online .
Young people who get jobs after graduating in the past quarter have surprisingly soared about 10 % , a figure that has nearly doubled as against that of last year .
In fact , the contributing factor lies in the fact that lots of students ask for others ' advice as information when they start to find jobs .
Such would be direct evidence bears witness to the fact that asking others ' advice is an efficient way to find a job .
And people will have the best memory , meaning they can remember things fast and hard , which saves much time that can be used to learn other subjects .
Under such circumstances , compared with learning financial management when people are old , learning this at a young age is a better option .
In this case , if the children know how to manage their money financially , the money could be saved , thus reducing the financial burden .
However , if children have learned to manage their own money financially , they can save lots of money by buying colas in regular shops .
However , although they can not understand , not only can their teachers review the skills , but also this experience about learning to manage money financially will help them in their future life .
Whether you believe it or not , I used to be a conventional person who was busy looking for a job all day long-just like a normal person . But three years ago , a chance completely changed my ordinary life .
`` But you have to make sure of your safety before you try to help somebody ! `` His words induced me into meditation .
And for the next three years , I 've been doing 1000 push-ups , 1000 sit-ups , 1000 squats , and a 100KM run every day .
`` Your muscles look stronger than those of a man who has been working out for ten years ! `` My best friend Michael said in surprise .
By working out so hard , I was able to reinvent myself and gain my best strength , but at the same time , I lost my hair and became a bald man .
The author of the passage and the professor in the lecture are both talking about the sources of strange sounds called `` quackers '' .
The author proposes three theories to explain the possible causes , while the professor opposes these theories respectively and points out their problems .
To start with , the author believes that the odd noises were made by orca whales who inhabited where the Russian submarines were patrolling because the noises were similar to the sounds of orca whales when they were trying to mate .
The reason is that orca whales live near the surface of the water in the area of patrolling , but the strange sounds were in the deep ocean .
Secondly , the author proposes that the sounds were made by giant squids , which can not be detected because of their soft body .
To rebut this claim , the author states that some facts can not be explained if giant squids are the right candidate .
Last but not least , the professor opposes the theory made by the author that the noises were caused by the military technology of another country .
The professor formulates that the strange sounds were moving around with great speed , but it is unlikely that submarines could move so quickly .
Secondly , city development is really fast , more and more people will come to the city , only use traditional way to grow plants can not afford a huge number of people to eat .
If the government puts the money into the construction of the Internet and allows people to use it for free , that means they can not get any profit from Internet construction .
What 's worse , if the expenditure on building Internet networks is over their last-year revenue , that will lead to a severe financial deficit .
Although the Internet plays an essential role during the pandemic , for some developing countries , allowing all people to use the Internet for free is unpractical .
Besides , there are still some people living in a primitive way without tap water and electronic bulbs , living in virgin forests or tropical forests , whose natural environment is difficult to construct modern facilities .
During the pandemic , exactly thanks to the Internet and other technology , we can work or study online so that we still get a salary .
Based on the overall national strategy and the whole river basin perspective , this paper analyzes the current situation of desertification and the problems of desertification combating the Yellow River Basin .
This paper hopes to provide a new idea for the overall coordination and quality development of green circulation in the Yellow River basin .
The bar chart illustrates the actual and projected change in the percentage of the population living in urban areas in six different regions in 1950 , 2007 , and 2050 .
It can be seen that Latin America has the most enormous population change in urban areas , while Africa has the least population change of the six regions .
For example , the trend can be seen in Asia and Africa where there is a significant increase of 47 % from 17 % to 66 % and from 15 % to 62 % percent respectively after one hundred years .
But the percentage of Asians and Africans in urban areas is still smaller than the urbanization rates in the other regions .
On the other hand , the change in urbanization percentage of Oceania is minor from 62 % percent to 76 % between 1950 and 2050 , but it is well below that of Latin America .
It is also clear from the graph that Europe keeps an increased rate that starts at 51 % , finishing the period at 84 % .
Initially , majoring in Applied Mathematics at Nanjing University of Finance and Economics developed my interests in various mathematical theories and applications in different fields , for example , Finance .
By reading books independently , I found that the mathematical applications in Finance are fascinating and became interested in the Finance field .
As a result , I transferred my major to Finance at Nanjing University of Finance and Economics to develop my interests academically .
I took all my efforts to enhance my knowledge in the Finance field and enrolled in Financial Markets , Microeconomics , Securities Investment , Private Equity Investment , and Finance Risk Management .
Not only do I achieve distinct academic performances and the overall cumulative grade point of average ranks top 10 % , but also build solid foundations in Finance .
Additionally , the courses I took at the School of Mathematics provided me with the opportunities to learn mathematical theories and numerical skills used in solving financial issues .
During the Asia-pacific Mathematical Modeling Contest , as I beginner , I represented incredible talent in mathematical modeling and comprehension of solving economic issues .
I gradually became interested in solving economic issues by using mathematical modeling and participated in contests to improve my modeling and analysis abilities .
In 2020 ICM , I applied Multiple Linear Regression and Dummy Variable economic models to analyze data to solve environmental issues .
Surprisingly , we achieved Finalist in the contest and broke the highest record of mathematical modeling at my school . The excellent achievements stimulated me and turned my passion into mathematical application in Finance to solve issues .
As a result , I put all my efforts to seek practical chances in Finance that can allow me to learn mathematical theories and contemporary economic concepts from a practical point of view .
Working as a data analyst at Hithink Flush Information Network Co. , Ltd enhanced my abilities in processing and analyzing financial data .
The duty involved in this internship gave me the opportunity to understand the companies ' financial statements and enabled me to obtain insights into financial markets from a practical point of view .
In the second experience , I participated in the project of China Minsheng Bank Corp as a research assistant with the aim of analyzing financial statements and measuring the credit risks based on the analysis .
As I found integrating financial information to evaluate companies and solve financial issues strengthened my desire to turn my passion for Finance into a career .
In contemporary society , a multitude of people is increasingly aware of the fundamentality of enriching students ' social experiences , one of the major ways is taking a part-time job .
Opinions are divided as to whether students should spend time taking part-time jobs or devote their time completely to academic study .
First and foremost , taking part-time jobs allows students to acquire introductory experiences of working in society and networking with other people , as opposed to the solitary pursuits involved in academic study .
I learned how to dress properly to attend conferences , how to talk to my boss appropriately , and how to negotiate with my co-workers when we held conflicting perspectives .
By taking a part-time job , I gained firsthand experience of working and enlarged my social network , which not only creates sweet memories for me but also can be beneficial for my future success .
She was already extremely busy with her schoolwork , yet she decided to take up the challenge of taking a part-time job .
She hung a large schedule on the wall in her room , which was neatly filled with every task 's due date , progress , and necessary details .
She kept organized in managing her time in this way even after she finished her job , which boosts her efficiency at whichever task she was handling .
Last but not least , after graduation , students with work experience are more accustomed to the professional world , and would be more attractive to their future employers .
Students themselves are already well acquainted with the workplace , thus they can stay in the novel working environment without wasting a great deal of time .
It comes to the question : if we need to enhance our performance in order to get better grades or higher work pay , we must do more additional work that is demanded or participate more actively or contribute our idea more frequently in the group discussion .
To be more concise , we usually need to collaborate with our colleagues and other departments , plus our experience with group discussions can help us become more familiar with those processes .
For example , when I was in college , I used to complete my project by myself because those assignments were not making me feel pressured .
Thus , I learn a section , that cooperation is an important part when we desire to get an excellent grade or ideal payment .
Through this process , students will learn some useful skills from teamwork , such as talking skills , leadership , or even making the task portion .
Admittedly , some people think that doing more extra work or assignments is most helpful to get better grades or high pay because in the short-term the performance of an individual is more apparent than teamwork .
In conclusion , with familiarity with teamwork when we come to a formal project and improve our social ability , I recommend that we participate more actively or contribute our ideas more frequently in the group discussion .
Education , the foundation of a highly developed country , has been valued and triggers a heated discussion over the ways teachers should be paid .
What should be prioritized is that assigning teachers payments based on their students ' performance is not favorable for teachers ' professional life .
To begin with , such a policy would increase teachers ' working pressure , as virtually all of the teachers want to get higher salaries .
They have to work harder than before , like improving their teaching methods and paying more attention to their students ' homework ; thus , more time and energy should be spent on work , which may make them feel exhausted every day , and lead to negative emotions every time they think of their work .
For instance , they might compete whose class got higher average scores on the school 's mid-term exam or whose students won more academic awards , which are parts of students ' performance .
Especially , if two teachers used to be close friends , they may not even want to talk with others because of their competitive relationship .
In detail , more homework would be assigned to students , and Math or English teachers may even take students ' sports classes for their lectures .
To conclude , I disagree that teachers ' salaries should be determined by how well their students perform because it does harm to both teachers and students .
As for the society , Mr. Philips begins by pointing out that `` at the grass-roots level , the society is rural '' , which has intimately corresponded to its Agrarian Society since ancient times .
In such a society of acquaintances , private morality preserves social orders , with filial piety and fraternal respect for parents , children , and compatriots , and loyalty for friends .
On the one hand , the changes in local society are extremely slow , so there are not many new problems to be solved through litigation .
On the other hand , the pattern of the different order and the various private morals that maintain the local society make the social status of people different , the boundary between people and themselves unclear , therefore , the power to resolve disputes and maintain social order is the psychological restraint of the actor and the education of the elder to the young rather than the litigation .
Modern judicial legislation is based on the context of the rule of law , and its social basis is the group pattern among people .
The characteristics of the group pattern are that people are equal to each other and there is a clear division of rights and duties between them .
Besides each person , there is a judge who transcends the power of the individual as a just and clear judge who adjusts the relationship between people , to control everyone 's behavior .
Nonetheless , there is no doubt that the rule of law is more suitable for the rapid development of modern society than the rule of etiquette or other social governance methods , which is the historical choice .
Although , as stated above , the long-standing habits of thinking and behavior in the local society will have some negative impact on the administration of Justice , and it ca n't be asserted that tradition only conflicts with or limits the modern administration of Justice .
In fact , China 's thousands of years of civilization for the rich connotation of the rule of law provides inexhaustible local resources , just to be good at use .
To make good use of the outstanding traditional culture , an essential understanding of the traditional culture should be on its premises .
The construction of society is based on the country 's existing conditions and the transformation and development of the modern judicial system , which has definitely reinforced the connotation of modern justice .
The expression of recognized macrophage marker CD68 and M1 macrophage marker HLA-DR analyzed by flow cytometry was significantly increased , compared with THP-1 cells ( Fig . 1A ) .
Simultaneously , after differentiation by PMA for 24h and polarization by IL-4/IL-13 for 96h , CD68 and M2 macrophage marker CD206 were detected by FACS analysis .
The Western blot analysis showed that expression of HLA-DR was increased in M1 compared to M2 macrophages , whereas M2 displayed rising expression of CD206 ( Fig . 1C ) .
The morphological differences between the THP-1 cells and M1/ M2 macrophages were observed by phase contrast microscope , and THP-1 cells remained spherical in suspension .
M1 macrophages displayed a spindle-like morphology with pseudopods , while the majority of M2 macrophages presented a rounded shape with dense granules and fewer pseudopods as compared to the M1 macrophages .
The passage illustrates whether there is a relationship between social media use and depression . The author asserts that we can not attribute the former to the latter .
Common sense indicates that there are a majority of potential problems of social media , like cyberbullying , screen addiction , and peer pressure . Moreover , the latest study in the journal JAMA finds out that there is a positive correlation between social media use and depression , which seemed to demonstrate people 's suspicion .
Meanwhile , social media users are distinct , which means that the relationships with social media are various , thus it is unreasonable for us to blame social media for causing mental problems .
In light of another study , problematic social media use can lead to mental illness , which points out the attribution of mental health instead of social media . Consequently , social media has nothing to do with depression in these cases .
In addition , correlation does n't mean causality , in other words , we can only infer the co-occur association between social media use and depression rather than causality .
All in all , the author proposes that we ought not to be opinionated and abandon using it but hold a rational attitude and use it in a modest way .
Under this circumstance , young people are also faced with a wide range of temptations and impacts brought by various objects , from fancy entertainment gadgets , to online pornography and to subversive conception , which is why there are many rules nowadays for youngsters to follow and obey to insulate them from juvenile delinquency .
However , some people may wonder whether some of these rules are too strict and serious and whether they should make a compromise .
First , some parents may order their children to devote most of their time to studying and prevent them from having access to leisure and entertainment .
Frequently , parents would have unreasonable expectations of their kids , hoping that they could show an outstanding performance in their school , be admitted into a top-rank university , and have a decent career right after graduation .
Because of these expectations , they would set a limit on hours which children could spend watching television and even register for all kinds of extra curriculums to make their children more competent than their peers .
But this teaching method will be very detrimental to their beloved sweethearts in that young children 's instinct prefers relaxing and exciting games and entertainment to tiring and killing studies and assignments .
In the long run , it is likely to turn a kid into a dumb nerd , who has no idea how to relax and enjoy each moment of life .
What 's the point of forging a child into an outstanding individual while he loses the fun and joy of life forever and ever ?
Second , some parents are likely to forbid their children from puppy love or any form of the intimate relationship they may establish with someone they like .
Some parents may be afraid that falling into an early-stage romantic relationship could be a distraction for their innocent kids , for which they may skip their regular classes to date or even earn bad grades in their mid-term or final exams .
Due to these fears and worries , parents usually curb any of their children 's close connection with a boy or a girl in the cradle .
Nevertheless , this is unhealthy for a child 's mental development because owning a longtime and steady relationship is an indispensable component in people 's lives .
If children have never had any experience of dealing with the person they have a crush on , they are likely to be sensitive to the other 's emotional reaction , thus being emotionally vulnerable when they become an adult .
For instance , too much entertainment and leisure could cause a child to indulge himself in it and get addicted ; falling in love with another person and thus forming an unhealthy obsession could cost a young child too much and take him a long time to recover .
But leaving children no time for fun and relaxation is too absolute , arbitrary , and even devastating , so we should make every effort to stop extremes from happening .
What irritated me was the fact that the offender received only negligible punishment , while Wang 's father , the person who suffered the loss , received no compensation .
While being saddened by my friend 's suffering , I also gradually became aware of the critical role of law in our daily life .
Therefore , I chose law as my lifelong career , wishing to acquire powerful tools that could be used to protect myself and have an impact on helping people in need .
The reasoning methods were as precise as the mathematical formulas , providing me with abundant tools to analyze legal issues , which I never found in domestic books .
Additionally , Professor Wang Qian , lecturer on the Intellectual Property Law course , told us that it was worth learning from the Common Law system , especially in the part of legal practice .
First , even though the reading passage suggests that up-agriculture creates more profits , the professor argues in the lecture that lots of relative charges will dilute the profits .
This is because you have to construct a tall building or buy an old building , which means each one costs you a lot .
Moreover , despite the statement in the reading that up-agriculture can produce less pollution than traditional agriculture , the professor contends that it will also increase light pollution .
Then she supports this point with the fact that because of the lack of sunshine in the building , people have to burn the funeral to generate electrical light . In other words , it creates more pollutants .
Finally , the professor asserts that making use of the land advisably is better than the author of the reading claims just to save the land .
First , even though the reading passage suggests that wz which prey in the depth of generating ocean snow will die because of lack of oxygen .
Moreover , despite the statement in the reading that wz was venerable when they eat , the professor contends that predators can not find wz easily since they can protect themselves effectively .
Then she supports this point with the fact that wz have dark skin and usually stay still in the deep ocean .
Finally , the professor argues that wz are special in their family , whereas the author of the reading claims that wz must hunt like their families .
The professor proves that this claim is indefensible by pointing out that because of their unique eating habits , they have fewer competitors .
Since we are all students depending on our parents financially yet , the rent for apartments shall be the largest part of our regular budget .
According to research conducted by the government , in China , the expense of dwelling accounts for more than 50 percent of youngsters ' monthly expenditure .
For example , when I lived alone last year , I had to pay 3000 yuan per month for house rent , which was almost equal to , if not more than , the sum of all other living expenses .
We can not only share the rent with roommates , but also other things like water fees , electronic charges , network fees , etc .
In particular , they can share many expensive devices like a Dyson hair dryer , vacuum cleaner , television , and air conditioning , which are heavy burdens for an individual .
Take my own experience for example : As the weather in my city is rather humid and gloomy , drying clothes naturally under the sun is hardly possible .
In a nutshell , finding roommates to share both the accommodation and other fees is the best way to reduce living expenses .
Although some people argue that slowing down economic development speed will bring some problems , it is impossible to guarantee people 's employment and increase income .
If economic growth is at the cost of living environments and people 's health , economic development will contradict its aim , of improving people 's well-being .
It is harder for people to find high-quality water , and even in some areas , people lack access to safe drinking water .
Every year , it attracts millions of people to travel and appreciate the tropical scenery and attracts many high-quality talents , such as programmers , lawyers , and company executives , to work there .
Since their high level can help them get a job in any big city globally , why choose a city crowded , traffic-ridden , polluted , and devoid of green spaces instead of a place with fresh air and far away from pollution ?
Since academic education is the basis of universities and colleges , some people suggest that it is a waste of money to invest in sports and social activities as well as classes and libraries .
Nowadays we always hear people complaining that graduates are lacking the capability to have effective communication with customers and colleagues , and they tend to blame it on the education of universities .
My experience of attending different sports and social activities lets me know what I need to take care of in communication , which improves my social ability and widens my social circle .
Since students are always busy with all kinds of schoolwork and term papers , spending an appropriate amount of time participating in activities is a good way to cultivate the capability to coordinate the relationship between activities and schoolwork .
Normally , people prefer to do one kind of thing all the time , because they are afraid that different activities may disturb their original lifestyles .
Actually , balancing both sports and social activities and academic courses contributes to the ability of time arrangement , and thus we can finish all the things on schedule availably .
While many people claim that they are too busy to take part in sports and social activities , I find it really a good way to improve my work efficiency .
After doing some outdoor activities like going to the gym or doing some community service work , my brain and body get a good rest and become way more energetic , which leads to high work efficiency .
That is , I can have more work done within a shorter time , which also means better performance in academic courses .
Accordingly , we come to the realization that in contrast to classes and libraries , sports and social activities play different yet indispensable parts in students ' lives , so they should receive equal financial support .
Our country has a gigantic population basic , approximately possessing 1 . 4 billion population , hence implementing the policy of allowing all high school students to gain the chance to go to college is not easy .
We should think about the feasibility of its practice . The fact is , obviously at present we did not have enough or sufficient universities to enroll such colossal students .
Fortunately , our nation has constantly increased the number of university enrollments and introduced a batch of measures to expand the scope of college Gaokao enrollment .
In conclusion , we can not simply develop the national enrollment policy randomly . The basic standard for decisions is based on the fundamental circumstance .
Therefore , from the perspective of controlling the education level as well as the sound atmosphere in the class , traditional and constitutional classes have limited the number of students .
We can make a bold assumption , all the 1 . 4 billion high school students have enrolled in the college , and then , we can see many people occupying the seats , while a lot of people stand , and some people even stand in the corridor .
These technological changes have promoted free trade , formed a larger market , and made the development of industry and commerce more vigorous .
Under this change , the old family-style industrial production mode can no longer meet the needs of trade development , so people are committed to improving production technology and production mode to increase output .
Not only do more people make money and improve their lives , but they also help many people achieve the American Dream faster and easier .
Whether it was the formulation of laws at the time or the more proficient science and technology , the Industrial Revolution increased social productivity and made human industrial civilization a big step forward .
For those who did not have a job to find a job , it was the ideal of those Americans or immigrants who wanted to achieve the American dream .
The Industrial Revolution prompted many people to fulfill the American Dream and opened the door to freedom for people from all over the world to come to fulfill the American Dream .
Everyone must work to live , but many people are fortunate enough to make more money than they immediately need .
While it is tempting for people to waste it all on things they desire , I believe it is better to save at least a majority of the extra income for the future .
At a time like this , their funds can spare them a great deal of suffering and help to see them through hard times .
They can then buy something more worthwhile than the small things they can but if they spend the money right away .
As technology and the economy are growing , more and more people seem to not save money , and even use loans , such as using Ant Check Later , to meet their buying needs .
While people may spend all their money on things they desire , I think it is better to save some money for the future .
I think the main reason why Starbucks LOGO changed its design is that over time , people 's thinking has become more conservative , so the LOGO has become simpler , more recognizable , and the colors more vivid .
As customers reported , the logo of the mermaid in the past was too realistic and direct , and the image had a `` sexual '' seductive element , like a mermaid tail with open legs , which was very unsightly .
From the first showing her belly button with her breasts and breasts , she still kept her belly button with her hair covered . The color was changed to green , which simplified the mermaid pattern .
With the lines and the poorly recognizable double fishtail , the mermaid has become more and more subtle , making the overall LOGO very simple .
In the third version of the LOGO , the lower body is directly hidden , and the left and right tails are only half displayed , which makes customers easily misunderstand that it is a mermaid 's hand .
In the last version , Starbucks removed the outer circle that originally surrounded the circular siren icon from the old trademark , and removed the words `` Starbucks Coffee '' originally located between the inner circle and the outer circle .
They should not vote to abolish the death penalty , because it is a more humane alternative to lifetime prison sentences , provides retribution to the victim 's relatives , and reduces the financial burden suffered by the government .
A miserable long-term living in prison is a cruel option for the prisoner who will be easily forgotten by people .
As Mitchell ( 2019 ) stated . `` Officially ruled a suicide , [ Roy Buchanan ] was found hanging in a cell at Fairfax jail in Virginia , his shirt tied around his neck , on August 14 , 1988 '' ( para . 22 ) .
People lost their chance to vent their anger and the prisoner died depressed which wo n't have any benefit to society .
The boring time and negative treatment accelerated his illness , which showed that the death penalty is a more humanized option for him .
In the study , we focus on erosion processes and wave action at the coastal line using aerial images and a numerical model .
We want to investigate the spatial distribution of lateral erosion rates and the relationship between the shape of the shoreline and erosion rates .
As my current research area is frozen soil , I have the knowledge of the Principles of geocryology , we can discuss the melting process of permafrost from the perspective of physical mechanics which is important to better explain the process of erosion .
To determine the geometry of shorelines and related erosion rates at a large spatial scale , we plan to use a suite of aerial images .
Using the digitized aerial images , we then compute coastal erosion and investigate long-term erosion rates as well as more recent and shorter-term rates of change .
In COAWST , the ocean model Regional Oceanic Modeling System ( ROMS ) , atmospheric model WRF , wave model Simulating Waves Nearshore ( SWAN ) , modules of the Community Sediment Transport Model , and sea ice model are fully coupled by means of the Model Coupling Toolkit .
The author of the reading thinks that there are several problems associated with a round-trip to Mars and earth , which makes a Mars mission impossible .
But the professor in the lecture challenges the idea and suggests that there are solutions to the problems presented in the reading .
First , the reading states that a trip to Mars takes at least two years and it is impossible for space vehicles to carry sufficient food , water , and oxygen to sustain the crew for two years .
But the professor provides contradictory evidence that astronauts who have worked in space stations for months have successfully tackled the issue by exercising regularly to prevent loss of muscle mass and taking vitamins to slow down the drop in bone density .
Finally , the reading claims that solar radiation is too dangerous for astronauts and there is no way for the spaceship to be shielded from such radiation the whole time during the trip .
And space ships can carry small equipment to provide small shields during the period when there is life-threatening occasional solar radiation .
In the reading material , the author cites three reasons to support his view that the pterosaurs do n't have the capacity for powered flight .
Nevertheless , the Lecturer in the listening material argues that it may be possible that pterosaurs were capable of powered flight , and opposes the points in the reading material .
First , the author argues that pterosaurs resembling other reptiles were cold-blooded , while other powered flying animals who can provide enough energy to fly are warm-blooded .
However , the lecturer offers the opposite stand that the fossils of pterosaurs indicate that pterosaurs might have dense fur or hair which can help maintain their relatively high temperature .
In addition , the lecturer casts doubt on the author 's another reason that pterosaurs were so over-weight that they could n't keep aloft by flapping their wings , demonstrating that the feature of hollow bones could lessen the weight of a pterosaur , and its wings could support a pterosaur with lighter bone frame .
Finally , the author 's third reason that because of the lack of back legs ' muscles , pterosaurs could impossibly take off like today 's birds whose back legs are very strong , is also counteracted by the lecturer who points out that the distinct walking style which involves all four limbs leads pterosaurs to take off easily .
Firstly , the author claims that the ancient Greeks ' technology is not enough to make a `` burring mirror '' given that the mirror requires a very precise parabolic curvature which ca n't be made in their time .
Secondly , the author asserts that the burning mirror takes quite a long time to set up the fire on ships and it 's impossible for ships to stay for that long time .
While the professor rubbishes it by stating that the burning mirror can set fire not only on wood but also on other materials .
So in such a short time , although the ship always keeps moving , they can still be set up on fire easily .
Finally , the author argues that flaming arrows can also do the same harm to ships and they are much easier to use .
But the professor refutes it by saying that flaming arrows are easy to see so their damage can be qualified to some extent .
Such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that unrelated major students studying history in universities are a waste of time .
As far as culture , technology and competition are concerned , my opinion is that it 's necessary for college students to learn about events that happened in the past .
To begin with , as history makes a civilization become what it is , learning history is definitely helpful for having a better understanding of our own nation .
In the meantime , history tells us the story of our cities : what the architecture was made for , how the city was established and how many disasters it had survived .
Not to mention the fact that the wisdom of our ancestors is so marvelous , and we should never look down upon them just because we have better technology .
My professor who was stuck with a project for a while decided to go through some historical articles which were related to his assignment .
Still , a voice arises that students who only master in their own field and know little about history are more competitive in interviews for concentrating better on their own major .
It 's kind of ironic that a person who does n't even know about what his or her country has gone through is unlikely to be a decent employee since a company could probably doubt a person 's loyalty who feels no connection to the people .
Certainly , some people may not share my point of view , as Raheel Farooq stated 'Men are different , sheep are all alike . '
