I agree with the statement that the ability to maintain friendships with a small number of people over a long period of time is more important for happiness than the ability to make many new friends easily .
First and foremost , we can confide a lot of our feelings to friends who have become our friends for a long period of time .
As we have known a friend 's situation and mindset for a long period of time , we can trust them to keep our secret .
When we got to know each other deeper and deeper , we found we are so similar , as we both have a sister and we are both kinds of shy .
Besides , maintaining friendships with a small number of people over a long period of time means having friends who grow up together with us .
When we have a connection with a small number since we were young and we maintained our friendship for a long period of time , we grow up together and witness the growth of each other .
As a result , when we communicate with our old friends and retrospect our old memories , we find they are so sweet and we find our happiness in them .
Above all , the ability to maintain friendships with a small number of people over a long period of time is more important for happiness than the ability to make many new friends easily .
Whether people should rely on others ' experience and knowledge or rely on themselves has become a vital part of our daily discussion .
People may focus on the pros and cons of different approaches and pay attention to the factors involving convenience , cost , and enjoyment .
When people ask me these questions , after stating that everyone 's opinion can be different about this , I would zero in on the cause and effect of the advantages of collecting the resources from our teachers and friends .
To begin with , if people use others ' experiences to help them solve the problem , it 's possible that they would get some professional advice .
In this case , on the condition that there is a problem to solve , it would take them much less time than others who rely on themselves to solve the same problem .
Accordingly , they would make fewer mistakes than others , because they have been told which approach would be easier to succeed .
To be specific , if people ask the way to solve the learning problem , they would tell you to be more hardworking in your spare time .
In this way , you would witness them work so hard and set up a positive example for you to follow , staying up to midnight , even overnight , for the fulfillment of their assignment .
Moreover , if you learn from others , it would be more possible that you would communicate with different people . In this case , it would be easier for you to learn how to get along well with others , how to understand and respect each other , how to focus on the things that they have in common , and tolerate the differences .
Some may argue that learning by yourself would be more effective because not all the experiences from others would help you in the end .
When people give you advice , they would always make sure that their opinion could work in the past , so there are only small possibilities to fail to solve your problem .
It requires a delicate balance of many criteria and a different mix of many approaches for different people and various situations .
As a result , while students make progress in an expected way , this might also pose a threat to the relationship between teachers and students .
Interest is the best teacher , which means once a teacher could successfully implement some teaching methods well suited to a student 's hobbies , he or she could gain students ' likes .
For instance , when a history teacher introduces a historical event with a popular video game related to it at the beginning , you can imagine how excited and involved students who love this game will become .
In this way , not only will students be more willing to concentrate on their studies and absorb knowledge thoroughly , but also they will consider their teachers as friends .
It is possible that teachers and students would discuss the latest trend together and students would have easy access to new points of view from teachers .
However , if a student who has won achievements begins to look into the whole process , I firmly believe that he would eventually realize that the importance of teachers should never be underestimated .
So they would be fully grateful to their teachers , especially those who really pave the way to their success despite the fact that the process at that time might be unpleasant .
To sum up , it is logical to say that teachers could be popular among students if they could help them in a proper manner .
In the reading material , the author cites three problems of sending humans to Mars , while in the listening material , the lecturer argues that although the project is challenging , there are solutions to the three problems given by the author .
First , the author argues that long distances and long-term trips need enough food , oxygen , and water for one 's 2-year wastage while the capacity of the spacecraft is limited .
The lecturer offers a solution that cultivating special plants in space vehicles can provide constant food and oxygen , and the plants can also recycle the water at the same time .
In addition , the lecturer cast a solution to the author 's another problem that people in zero-gravity environments suffer from severe medical problems , demonstrating that many astronauts in space stations keep healthy and safe for months .
Finally , the author 's third problem that excessive space radiation will harm people who leave Earth 's magnetic field is also tackled by the lecturer who points out that solar radiation occurs occasionally which is as dangerous as we thought .
Once the minuscule physiological signals were measured , I would then use a Bluetooth module to output the arterial blood pressure waveform to an Android platform to do real-time monitoring .
I have always absorbed relevant expertise in software , and I strived to be the first scrum master and primary code reviewer on our team without a direct computer science background .
The cognition of most of them , as students , is based on the knowledge learned from schools and parents , which is not sufficient to make them discriminate between right and wrong .
For instance , some students can not understand why they have to learn varieties of subjects and finish their homework since it is difficult to imagine the benefits brought from the knowledge they have been studying by then .
Their parents and teachers will know more about this and set up a series of rules to help youngsters to walk on the brilliant road to success .
Along with prosperous information technology , youths have been more accessible to violence and porn from the Internet than in the past .
Some rules , such as forbidding youngsters to browse adult websites and purchase adult books , are effective and straightforward ways to prevent these things from taking place .
Without the rules , young people are easily addicted to this bad information when it comes to sex and violence , resulting in a waste of time and energy .
However , she thinks that the real reason for the octopus stranded on the beach is still a mystery , which contradicts what the reading states .
First , even though the reading passage argues that some scientists thought that octopus stranding because they want to prey , the professor argues in the lecture that preying can not explain the unusual phenomenon .
Then she supports this point with the fact that local residents who find the octopus can not distinguish if the octopus is female or not , and besides , a mature female octopus should be bigger and worn out .
Finally , the professor asserts that there is not enough evidence to prove octopuses are escaping from the stormy ocean , whereas the reading passage claims that the storm compels octopuses to escape to the beach .
The professor proves that this claim is indefensible by pointing out that there are no scars on the octopus and no evidence to show that they are sensitive to the storm .
Learning about life science will provide us with an opportunity to get in touch with nature . When learning universal science , we will have a broader view of this world .
Recently , a prevalent saying we hear is that it is easier to be well-educated today than it is in the past .
A considerable number of opponents , however , argue that there is no obvious evidence to indicate the existence of this kind of phenomenon since we are living in a really fast-paced society and it is really easy to neglect the quality of education .
What must be prioritized is that with the development of technology , students could get access to all kinds of knowledge easily .
In detail , the internet is a powerful tool to help us to get what we are really interested in and what we are good at .
And so , it is students who are eager to broaden their horizons and enrich their knowledge that will make full use of important learning methods .
However , children will never enjoy the benefits brought by this valuable learning tool if the internet is not invented by scientists .
To be more specific , students could contact their friends more conveniently because of the emergence of numerous instant message applications which means they could solve their problems and find the right answers quickly and efficiently .
What should be equally worth discussing is that the promotion of comprehensive quality and knowledge of citizens are also related well to education .
To explore deeper , parents nowadays , who are equipped with the knowledge , attach more and more attention to the education of their children because they all believe that a good education usually guarantees a brilliant future .
Additionally , the increased professional ability of teachers , like advanced teaching concepts and methods , also encourages schools to offer a better education .
In summary , we may safely draw the conclusion that it is easier for students nowadays to be well-educated because of advanced technologies and the improvement of teaching methods .
Even though chemical analysis was a major that I was not familiar with , I showed great activeness in participating in the whole activity .
With the help of high-quality management tools and the intimate cooperation of our group members through a long period of the PDCA cycle , we finally developed a new method whose efficiency was 3 times more than that of the old one .
To promote our new method and innovative activity , I attended the 44th International Convention on Quality Control Circles in Tokyo known as the Olympics of quality control activities in the world .
During this convention , I made the presentation in English and won the golden award on behalf of our company which was the first time I won this award in the history of CSSC .
Although many countries today regard economic growth as the primary goal of their national development plans , they must not blindly pursue economic growth at the cost of the environment .
Some people who are in favor of vigorous economic development may think that when the economy grows rapidly , the country can invest more money to make up for the damage caused by the environment of economic growth .
But problems such as the hole in the ozone layer and soil erosion are largely irreversible , causing permanent damage to the environment .
To be more specific , in some places with a beautiful natural environment , the local government can develop a series of tourism projects to attract tourists .
Local residents can increase their income by opening hotels and restaurants , and local factories can also produce some tourist souvenirs to get richer returns .
In this way , the general living standard of the local people will be improved , and the government 's tax revenues will be increased .
Of course , the government also has the responsibility to maintain the environment of scenic spots , and only in this way can we get a steady stream of tourists .
Many developed countries offer zero-interest loans to protect the environment to developing countries , and they also send environmental experts as consultants to developing countries to help them solve environmental pollution problems .
With the support of the international community , developing countries are in a better position to maintain a balance between economic development and environmental protection .
Due to the one-child policy , a large number of children born after 2000 have great problems dealing with their families and friends .
When it comes to dealing with family and friends , some people think that being away from the people we care about makes us cherish those relationships , while others hold the opposite view that being away will cause relationships to be damaged .
In my perspective , I support the second idea that being far away from the people we care about will hurt relationships .
I support the second idea because the distance will generate a sense of alienation and relationships are difficult to rebuild and maintain .
What is more serious is that friends are cut off simply because they have n't kept in touch for a long time .
The more people get engaged in their life , the less they pay attention to their relations , and it becomes a matter of concern for many sociologists that people become less and less in contact with each other .
Finally , some people argue that being far away provides a chance for reflection which makes people realize the importance of these relationships .
In conclusion , when people stay away from someone they care about , the relationship gets hurt because it leads to alienation and the relationship is difficult to rebuild and maintain .
If people want to build a good relationship with their families and friends , the best way is to communicate rather than avoid them .
So , only staying with them can make people understand the difficulty of maintaining relationships and cherish their relationships between family and friends .
However , the speaker in the lecture claims that it 's possible for pterosaurs to be capable of flying , and this contradicts what the reading says .
Nevertheless , the lecture provides an opposite stand that with dense feathers covering their body , pterosaurs may have the ability to maintain their body temperature and generate enough energy to fly .
Further , the lecture runs counter to the author 's another point that pterosaurs are so big that they would be too heavy to fly , proving that with a specific structure of hollow bones , pterosaurs might be light enough to fly despite their huge sizes .
Lastly , the author 's third reason that pterosaurs ' back legs are too weak to launch them into the sky is also rebutted by the lecturer who shows that , unlike birds who walk only with two hind limbs , pterosaurs can launch their bodies with all four legs like bats to run and jump into the sky .
Friends play a crucial role in people 's lives since we share our happiness and sadness with them and turn to friends for help when we face difficulties .
Therefore , some people would wonder which is the most significant factor that helps maintain a friendship : sharing the same interests , helping friends , or trusting each other .
There is no denying that only when people trust their friends will they share their inner secrets with each other , which would result in a deeper understanding of each other .
On the contrary , if a friendship lacks trust , people may only focus on superficial topics , such as common interests like sports , work , or music , which could not mirror an individual 's real personality .
Under these circumstances , they may find that there are great differences between them when facing problems and the friendship would easily break up .
To be specific , a trust allows people to expose their vulnerable parts to their friends since they believe that friends would not hurt them even if the friend knew their weakness and would encourage them instead .
It is common that when people have a hard time dealing with life , they come to chat with friends to share their negative feelings but not merely ask for advice .
After that , people could release the pressure and get more courage to solve problems , which also contributes to an improvement of friendship .
A friend that helps in emergencies is reliable and people would turn to him or her when they are confronted with problems .
Also , people may spend plenty of time chatting with friends that have common interests , which could make the friendship last longer .
However , friendship is not a panacea for emergencies , considering the fact that friends usually can not offer help directly . The only thing they can do is listen to the complaint and give emotional support , which is also based on trust between friends .
Furthermore , without trust , people could not deepen their understanding of each other despite their sharing amount of common interests so the relationship between them would not last for a long time .
In sum , considering what was discussed above , we can draw a conclusion that trust is the most important element in a friendship since it not only allows people to understand each other better but also encourages their friends when needed .
Recently , more and more reports reported that lots of restaurants adopted unfresh materials to make dishes , and some restaurants even use chemical components to make their dishes more competent .
These unhealthy dishes will cause great harm to people 's health and some people will even be addicted to one restaurant 's dishes because of addictive drugs in their dishes .
However , if students master the skill of cooking , they can eat much healthier , because they will use fresh vegetables to cook , and can control the usage of chemical additions . What 's more , with the rapid growth of modern cities , more and more people choose to leave their hometowns and even go abroad to find their opportunities .
When people feel homesick , mastering the skill of cooking dishes that contain their hometown 's flavor will be of great help since they can still have their home flavor in a remote area .
The passage talks about three theories about how agnostids lived , while the professor argues that all of them have weaknesses and refutes them one by one .
To counter this view , the professor mentions that swimming predators always have large eyes and high eyesight in order to see prey .
They only live in local places and occupy small regions , while agnostids occur at multiple and large distances as well as move fast from one place to another which are all unusual for seafloor dwellers .
The professor contradicts this opinion by stating that the population of parasites needs to be small unless the large animals are killed by parasites .
The capability to change and grow is the main characteristic of the growth mindset , and it means that people can always try to achieve their goals even if these tasks are difficult .
The first time I learned to ski was in an impressive indoor ski resort . Obviously , I could hardly walk around when I put on my ski boots , which are very heavy , and I needed to take time to get used to them .
Then slowly I was able to stand up and walk freely in the snow , and I was able to master some balance , but I was still afraid of the slippery feeling .
The first challenge is to overcome my fear that I am worried I will fall down . I tried to practice dozens of times , and all my friends can ski enjoyably , however , it is still impossible for me . At that time I understand that it is a natural thing for people to feel self-doubt when people meet a problem in life . At that time , I also feel frustrated and full of fear of failing in my mind , but I always want to change and grow , so I decided to ask for some strategies from my friends , and then they gave me useful feedback and suggestions .
The growth mindset theory has had a great impact on me . It explained why many people do not want to change . In my experience , when I try to ski several times later , I fell into self-doubt because all my friends can enjoy this sport , but I am struggling . This feeling which fear of ridicule led to fear of failure , and make me believe that natural abilities can decide whether things can succeed or not .
The fixed mindset is a horrible cycle , but it can be changed because the Mindset of people is complex , people can switch their mindset from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset . For example , when I believe myself is a person who always wants to learn more skills , I start to pay more effort to skiing and overcome the fear of failure , so I can improve my ski skills .
Also , if you want to get a friend who accompanies you for a long period of time , you need a number of skills .
So I truly agree with the idea that the ability to maintain friendships with a small number of people over a long period of time is more important for happiness .
To begin with , a small number of people you have known for a long time must know what your ambitions and favors are .
Through this relationship , you could talk to them when you are in trouble with something or you feel like sharing your success with them .
So I definitely think this kind of friend that I maintain can truly help me because he knew what my ambitions are and I could also talk to him about what bothered me a lot recently .
For instance , when studying in college , I always borrowed money from friends that I have already maintained in primary school through Wechat rather than my roommates because I would not know if they could do it .
This would be more interesting than going outside with roommates in school because we never know which place is our favorite .
Conclusively , maintaining friends for a long period of time always has the advantages of talking to them about situations , helping you in a dilemma , and playing with them more interesting .
So I definitely agree with the idea that it will be more important for happiness to maintain friends for a long period of time .
Even if the same steps were taken as in state 1 , it got worse results later due to the difference in resources .
This implies that the adoption of sustainability criteria including the standards proposed by scholar Daley in development as soon as possible will produce more positive results .
Furthermore , this requires maintaining the stability of sustainability policies , otherwise , the decreased resources will seriously inhibit function from resource usage rate or the assimilation rate .
Humanistic speaking , if a political party pursues its own interests and leads to intermittent sustainability policies , no matter which party or interest group ultimately wins , it is ultimately the loss of humans .
When the times go up , group members will gather together and discuss the project to make sure the progress will not be influenced .
During the practice , group members can receive dire feedback from each other and modify their mistakes immediately , which may give a better performance on the presentation day .
Admittedly , it is very convenient to deliver some files by sending e-mails , but it will be useless if there is no explanation from group members .
For example , classmates can prepare the files they need in advance , so they can show them to other members during the discussion .
In the meantime , they can also give some explanation about why this file is so important and what that data shows , which can provide other members with a clearer claim about the project .
In conclusion , this essay can conclude that communicating group projects in person will bring better work than using e-mail in terms of much more effectiveness , avoiding potential problems , and more clear claims .
Having a glimpse of the progress in technologies , the application of the mobile phone and other advanced applications are the universe in children 's education .
With the development of technology , the variety of apps installed on your electronic device has increased to a great number in recent years .
In common circumstances , even for adults studying with mobile phones , it 's hard not to open the smartphone , scan news and so on , let alone the children .
In recent years , the flourishing of emerging industries like short videos has motivated the rapid progress in the original creation which was so fascinating that you get indulged in that easily , forgetting due tasks .
Time is limited , so if we consume time to entertain ourselves , less time will be left for us to complete our academic tasks .
In a word , based on the reasons mentioned above , the time they spend on smartphones should be controlled to enhance education among children .
After the innocent old man dies , the murderer destroys the evidence of the crime and successfully conceals the old man 's body under the floor .
Many years later , as I face the speedily changing world , I still remember that distant afternoon when my father asked me who I would want to be and my understanding of what a purposeful and productive life is .
In a time of dizzying technological achievement and of rapid scientific innovation , it seems that there is only one way to have a successful , purposeful , and productive life -- - take `` practical '' courses and earn a lot of money .
The former means following your own living purpose with passion and the latter means making the world a better place for others .
Whether it is fixing the car or exploring the world , one should be passionate about the goal and set a path to achieve it .
As you can see , those who found big companies such as Google , Apple , and Microsoft follow their passion and finally live a purposeful life .
I always believe that what makes them great is not the money or fame they have got but their courage to pursue their passion and to accomplish their living purpose .
In all , if someone wants to follow his or her own living purpose instead of others ' expectations , pursuing passion is first and foremost .
Besides , I have to argue that a true `` purposeful and productive '' man not only possesses a purposeful life but also spares no effort to lead people surrounded to make a difference to the whole society .
As is known to us all , our society has come a long way since the last century , but there are still many tough problems hidden in the corners .
For example , even though our world becomes increasingly rich , there are still some villages where people lack basic equipment to live .
It is impossible for one person to solve hard problems like this alone , so the ability to cooperate with others is essential .
Only when we lead our teammates to make joint efforts can we have the possibility to overcome the difficulties we are faced with .
I know how hard it is to tell him perhaps I will choose a way that is not the same as his , my neighbors ' , or my classmates ' way .
But at the same time , I also know how proud and delighted he would be when I follow my purpose with passion and make the world a better place in order to live my purposeful and productive life .
Having known her for four years , I was impressed by her great performance and agreed to write this letter to her without any hesitation .
She has worked with me on a project preparation and optical properties research of InP nanowires and I found that she has brilliant ability in the aspect of professional research .
I remember that she spent her whole summer vacation staying at the lab voluntarily in want of seeking an ideal condition for them and then succeeded .
In short , I am sure you will be impressed by her academic potential as well as persistent efforts in her major if you can give her a chance .
The shrimp industry has been a backbone in fishing as it provides job opportunities for numerous people and satisfies the needs of marine cuisine .
As the cages sweep through the targeted area , however , there are other species that have been unintentionally caught in the net , which have posed a great threat to the balance of the marine ecosystem .
The fishing `` cage '' for shrimp is called the trawl , and there have been incidents in which turtles were captured , without the chance of escaping .
The device has a mechanical barrier attached to the fishing net ; whenever a species larger than 10cm touches it , the cage tilts automatically , providing the turtles with a chance of escaping .
The first concern is that only creatures that are 10 cm or longer in length have the chance of escaping , meaning baby turtles would most likely still be trapped in the barrier .
The second issue is that there have been instances where larger shrimp species escaped from the barrier , causing a loss of money for the industry .
Lastly , it is impossible for the government to check if each boat actually follows the policies and whether they have a TED document or not .
To make matters worse , ships could obtain fake documents , and the diversity of the policies in different countries cast more doubt on the usage of TED .
In the reading material , the author cites three reasons to support the viewpoint that using a box-shaped device surrounding the young trees to fight desertification will not be successful .
Nevertheless , the lecturer in the listening material argues that the three reasons mentioned in the reading material are not convincing , and the devices are used widely now .
First and foremost , the author argues that these devices cost a lot of money which means some countries could not afford them .
However , the lecturer offers an opposite stand that these devices can be removed , and each of them can be used 20 times or more to grow new young trees , so actually , this function can make the expenditure more rational .
In addition , the lecturer casts doubt on the author 's another reason that the people living in the desert can not get some benefits from the trees and at the same time , they need to take care of these trees .
First , the devices can collect water for other plants which means people can use the water to grow vegetables and other plants .
Finally , the author 's third reason is that these devices ' ability to collect and conserve water is small , and after these trees get older , the water will not be enough for them , especially in some places that hardly have rainfall .
This idea is also counteracted by the lecturer who points out that the devices help trees grow very long roots , so they can absorb water from very deep soil which is under the dry surface .
In addition , The purpose of constructing a publicly available online tool was to visually demonstrate the elective irradiation schemes and to facilitate the clinical use of these schemes .
However , due to the word limit of the Abstract , we did not add the link to the website to the Abstract Result section .
In my opinion , people benefit more from traveling to foreign countries , for they can enhance their foreign language ability and broaden their horizons .
When people travel to other countries , they must speak the local language and they need to pay attention to their tunes and grammar .
This is the real environment to test your language because if you can speak the local language in the right way , the local people can understand what you mean .
For example , when I traveling in England , I always needed to use English in any situation . This made me feel nervous and I tried my best to speak English clearly .
This experience really helps me , and I realise that there still are many accents and grammar problems in my English speaking , so I decided to solve them with further practice .
Second , traveling to foreign countries can help people to broaden their horizons because the foreign countries ' cultures are totally different from their own country . They have different religions , different environments , and different art .
For example , when I was traveling in China , I was totally shocked by their amazing culture . China has a very long history and unique culture . I visited the great wall and the Forbidden City . The unique building feature gave me a deep impression , and I got to know that wood can also build a very huge building and why ancient Chinese people could build the Great Walls on the mountain .
All of them helped me to broaden my horizons and made me realize that there are so many interesting things in other countries .
The two individuals with different nationalities also had very different approaches to the fight for civil rights . The King demands a nonviolent approach to fighting for equality , while X resorts to violence when necessary .
King has always been an advocate of nonviolence and believed strongly that violence would not necessarily lead to equality for black people .
Therefore , in King 's letter , King proposes that his supporters use `` sit-ins and marches '' instead of violence and hatred , because `` for there is the most excellent way of love and nonviolent protest '' ( King , 28 ) .
This quote shows that King wants people to adopt a peaceful and loving way of fighting for black people 's equality .
At the same time , he argues that `` I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure '' ( King , 12 ) .
In King 's opinion , he believes that it is the law and nonviolence that can make it easier for black people to fight for civil rights and achieve their goals .
This is not to say that nonviolence would have higher effectiveness , but in contrast , only a nonviolent movement will have more people 's support and convince more masses to participate in the Civil Rights Movement , thus making it easier for the black Civil Rights Movement to succeed .
As a black person , X suffers too much oppression , exploitation , and discrimination from white people , and witnesses too much white violence against black people , which makes X hate white people and use violence to fight back against them .
When X is persuading black people to join the Civil Rights Movement and fight for their civil rights , he recounts that `` article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun '' .
Although X does not exactly explicitly call for the use of violence to enforce the civil rights of black people , he is in an indirect way and the realm of vagueness that hints to his supporters that the use of guns is legal and that they can use guns to protect their civil rights and the rights for equality , education , and economic opportunity .
At the same time , he defends himself by saying that `` this does n't mean you 're going to get a rifle , form battalions and go out looking for white folks , although you 'd be within your rights - I mean , you 'd be justified `` ( X , 60 ) .
This quote seems to mean that X is not asking black people to take guns to kill white people to achieve equality and civil right , but X 's `` you 'd be justified '' to use violence is the main point of the whole sentence .
On the surface , X does not point out the need to use guns against white people , but he hints to his audiences that it all makes sense that black people have the right to use guns to achieve victory in the Civil Rights Movement .
Once again , it is clear that X 's message to his supporters is that he wants them to use violence in the necessary situations to achieve their goals .
As a result , King and X have different positions on the use of violence or non-violent action to achieve the Civil Rights Movement .
The first theory mentioned by the author is that the odd noises were caused by the orca whales , which inhabited the zones of submarine detecting .
On the contrary , the lecturer points out that orca whales would dive into the deep ocean , meaning their sounds could not be heard .
The second theory demonstrated by the writer is that the sounds come from giant squid , an invertebrate that could not be detected by sonar .
